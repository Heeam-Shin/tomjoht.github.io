<p>Jack shares some trends in the technical communication industry. He says writers need to become hyphenated to move forward and be successful in the future. Jack owns a technical writing staffing company and also produces the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lavacon.org/" title="Lavacon">Lavacon conference</a>, which is in New Orleans this year, but is traditionally in Hawaii. Jack says users aren't concerned about polished language these days; they just want accurate, relevant content.</p>
