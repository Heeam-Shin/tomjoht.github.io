<p>Deanne, host chapter president of the Twin Cities chapter, talks about the emerging trend of Web 2.0. She also comments on the need to change our image from writer to communicator. John, a consultant from Vermont, also explains how writers must go beyond just writing and instead branch into other areas, such as information architecture and usability. Both Deanne and John, former teachers of technical communication, comment on the marriage technical communication must have between both business and academia.</p>
