<p>RoboHelp 6 was launched today. Here is their list of new features. (This list is from their "<a href="https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&view=ols_prod&category=/Applications/RoboHelp&distributionMethod=FULL&NR=0" target="_blank">Reasons to Upgrade to RoboHelp 6</a>.")</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>New user-defined variables</strong><br />
Define global variables for certain text elements; change a variable once, and RoboHelp changes all other instances of this variable in your Help.</p>
<p><strong>New RoboScreen Capture</strong><br />
Capture screens, edit screen captures, and export images to common file formats with the new built-in screen capture and image editing tool.</p>
<p><strong>More conditional build tags</strong><br />
Apply conditional build tags to table of contents and index items and folders to tailor output for different formats and purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Adobe PDF support</strong><br />
Generate accessible PDF files with support for hyperlinks and bookmarks with the included Adobe Acrobat® Elements software.</p>
<p><strong>New command line compilation</strong><br />

{% include ads.html %}
<p><strong>New reports on build tags</strong><br />
Generate snapshots of the number and type of build tags used in your Help project.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Adobe RoboSource Control</strong><br />

<p><strong>Improved compatibility</strong><br />
RoboHelp 6 includes numerous compatibility and stability enhancements, including improved import of Microsoft Word content, improved installers, and improved publishing of projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My main question is about the conditional build tag improvement. In RoboHelp 5, it was impossible to apply index tags to the character level. If your topic was half suppressed in a conditional build, all the index keywords for the topic showed up regardless. It appears that this has been fixed in RoboHelp 6, although I haven't tested it.</p>
<p>Rick Stone has written an excellent article on <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/buildtag.html" target="_blank">conditional tagging in RoboHelp 6</a>.</p>
