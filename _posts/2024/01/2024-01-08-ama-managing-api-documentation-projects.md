description: "I recently participated in a Coffee and Content chat titled 'Ask Me Anything: Managing API Documenation Projects', with Patrick Bosek and Scott Abel, sponsored by Heretto. This was an 'Ask me anything' style chat, though the audience could only participate through chat on Brighttalk's platform. The coffee chat took place on Thursday, Jan 11, 2024."

The topic was pretty open-ended. Here are a few of the topics that came up:

* The tech writer is pulled in too late into the release cycle.
* Bug reports lack detail to be actionable.
* Engineers are confused about the tech writer role.
* Tech writers prioritize projects based on whoever is shouting the loudest for docs.
* Engineers are slow to review docs, dragging out timelines.
* Attention focuses only on documenting the latest features, not maintaining existing content.
* The tech writer discovers confusing API behavior too late to influence the product design.
* No time to test pre-release productsâ€”setup too hard.
* Dividing tasks among multiple writers for the same project is too difficult.
* Complex release cycles and processes are opaque.
