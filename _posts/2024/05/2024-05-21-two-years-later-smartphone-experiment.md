description: "Two years ago, I started an experiment to reduce my smartphone usage. While I've reverted to using my smartphone regularly, I've learned a lot along the way. I've realized there's an inverse relationship between book reading and phone usage, and I've made a conscious effort to prioritize reading more books, especially with the reinforcement of book clubs. I've also accepted that while smartphones are necessary, it's the constant notifications that contribute to anxiety. By removing most social media and news apps, I've switched to a pull model for information, reducing my stress levels. I've found that news isn't as valuable as I once thought, and now I prioritize pulling information when I need it. I still have a lot to figure out, but I'm happy with the progress I've made and the lessons I've learned about myself and my relationship with technology."
