description: "I added another article to my prompt engineering series on reverse engineering prompts. Reverse engineering a prompt can mean a few different things, but in this article, I'm referring to deriving the likely prompt based on a given output. For example, you pass in some finished content and ask the AI to write a prompt that would produce a similar output. Although reverse engineering prompts might not be all that different from simply coming up with a template for docs, I added this article here to emphasize that you can get AI to write prompts for you, and many times these prompts are good. They can be much more detailed and robust than manually written prompts."
