description: "In this article, I describe a method to use the AI to fact-check its own output against source materials. The better your source materials, the more likely you'll be able to identify errors. However, even with this method, human review by SMEs (subject matter experts) is still necessary. Unfortunately, getting SMEs to thoroughly review drafts can be difficult. Additionally, SMEs have such specialized knowledge, it's easy for one SME to LGTM a doc without having 100% certainty about each part."
