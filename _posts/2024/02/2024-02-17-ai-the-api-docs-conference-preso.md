Here's a [description of the conference](https://ti.to/pronovix/ai-the-docs-2024):

> **The First-Ever Online Conference about the Intersection of Generative AI and API Documentation**
>
>AI The Docs 2024 promises a full-day single-track event, featuring keynote presentations, curated talks, and an exhibit of cutting-edge API docs-related AI features, tools, services, and practices. ...
> 
> The conference will emphasize existing use cases for generative AI tools in API documentation and developer portals. Participants can expect in-depth discussions on improving AI readiness within organizations, real-world examples of AI tools in practice, and the exploration of new dimensions in API docs with Generative AI.

I'll be one of the speakers. I'm planning to talk about prompt engineering. I've started a series on [prompt engineering here](/ai) if you want to get a better sense of what I've been up to.
