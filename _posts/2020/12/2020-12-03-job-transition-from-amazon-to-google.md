description: "I recently switched jobs from Amazon to Google. I'm still in the Bay area right now, but before the end of 2020 I'll be relocating to Seattle. I had been at Amazon in Sunnyvale for nearly 5 years and was ready for a change. Plus, I've always been captivated by the ambitiousness of Google. I will continue to post regularly on my blog and API course. Just a reminder: my views are always my own and never any representation of a company. I'm excited for the upcoming challenges and other new encounters at Google. I both welcome and look forward to experiences that reshape my thinking processes, challenge me to try new things, and present formidable challenges to overcome."
