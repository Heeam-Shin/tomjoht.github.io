description: "One of the main ways I use AI is with thematic analysis, which involves identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within qualitative data. After you identify major themes, you can use least-to-most prompting techniques to go into more detail. I recently used this technique in preparing notes for a book club. It could also could work well for a number of documentation-related scenarios. In this article, I explore using AI for thematic analysis with doc feedback, search analytics, tags and related pages, FAQs, glossary items, bugs, and documentation pages."
