description: "I added a new article to my API course about using AI to create doc updates based on bugs. By bugs, I'm referring to small issues often surfaced by users about the docs. Bugs are often long lists of random fixes to make with the docs, often involving a small number of changed lines. However, interpreting the bugs can be challenging. Fortunately, AI tools can help you understand the issue and resolution."
