description: "I added a new article to my API doc course on using AI for language advice. When you have questions about style, grammar, or other syntax, try asking your favorite AI tool. AI tools can do an excellent job at identifying the particular grammar or style rule or reason, and they can provide guidance about why one phrasing is preferable to another. In asserting a preference, AI will often make a convincing argument for one style over another, such as noting that a word could be interpreted in different ways and so is more ambiguous than the other phrasing."
