description: "I added a new article in my API course called 'AI and APIs: What works, what doesn't'. In conversations about AI, a lot of people ask the same questions: What kind of scenarios is AI good for? What works, what doesn't? In which scenarios? This article focuses on clarifying those scenarios where AI excels and where it doesn't, particularly for technical writers creating documentation. I also argue for the inevitability of AI integration through an argument referred to as the 'obsolescence regime.'"
