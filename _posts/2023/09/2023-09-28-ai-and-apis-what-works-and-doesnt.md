description: "I added a new article in my API course called <i>AI and APIs: What works, what doesn't</i>. In conversations about AI, a lot of people ask the same questions: What kind of scenarios is AI good for? What works, what doesn't? In which scenarios? This article provides an overview describing those scenarios where AI excels and where it doesn't. I also argue for the inevitability of AI integration through an argument referred to as the 'obsolescence regime.'"
