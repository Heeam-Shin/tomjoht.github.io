description: "Compiling and maintaining glossaries can be time consuming. Can AI tools help with glossaries? Just as AIs are good at creating summaries, providing definitions might be one of AI's strengths. A definition is just a short summary of a concept. AI tools are also good at identifying potentially unfamiliar, jargon-filled terms and then listing concise definitions for them."
