## News turns the content wheel of advertising

For most of my blog’s history, my newsletter has contained links to my own blog’s articles. With this approach, I could only send out about one newsletter every two weeks, depending on how prolific I was on my blog. I usually included one substantial article per newsletter.

The book provides tips for seeing the familiar in new ways, which is an idea I’m intrigued by. I became intrigued by the art of noticing even before I discovered the book. To avoid boredom, I often play a game of trying to notice 3 things around me that I’ve never noticed ... [Read more »](/blog/art-of-noticing-rob-walker-book-review)

## AI starting to diminish work for student essay ghostwriters

Apparently, the popularity of using ChatGPT to write high school essays has impacted the contract cheating market, which had a lot of ghostwriters in Kenya. See AI is taking the jobs of Kenyans who write essays for U.S. college students. My first reaction was, hooray, fewer essay cheating services! But as I thought more, I realized that reducing the reliance on human ghostwriters, and instead using AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard, means cheating is ...
