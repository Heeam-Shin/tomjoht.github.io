description: "I recently gave a webinar titled 'Experiments and use cases for AI from a tech writer’s perspective' on December 8, 2023. The webinar was sponsored by the STC Washington, DC - Baltimore Chapter. In this presentation, I shared some personal experiences in using AI for different writing-related use cases, explaining what I’ve found helpful. These use cases and takeaways were all experiential, based on my experiments with using AI both in the workplace for documentation-related scenarios and writing on my blog."

Here's the webinar description:

> **Experiments and use cases for AI from a tech writer’s perspective**
> 
> Since AI has gone mainstream and promised to transform many professions, including tech comm, many of us have been exploring and experimenting with AI in different use cases. We know it’s important to learn these AI tools, but in what situations do we use AI, and how can AI help? Conversely, in what situations does AI backfire? In this presentation, I’ll share some personal experiences in using AI for different writing-related use cases, explaining what I’ve found helpful. These use cases and takeaways are all experiential, based on my experiments with using AI both in the workplace for documentation-related scenarios and writing on my blog.

## More details

Here's a little more of why I chose this topic and what I covered. Last month I published a podcast titled [AI and APIs: What works, what doesn't](/blog/ai-apis-what-works-and-doesnt-video-recording-podcast). In that podcast, I tried to describe 10 solid use cases for using AI with documentation, especially API documentation. However, since giving that presentation, I noticed an increasing attitude of skepticism and apathy toward AI. Whether it was just my social circles or a broader sentiment, I got the sense that people were tired of the hype about AI without seeing more direct application of AI to improve their lives and make their work easier. 

Rather than focus the use cases on documentation, in this presentation I wanted to be more informal and explain how, when, and where I'm using AI tools, whether the scenarios related to documentation scenarios or not. In the presentation, I covered about 20 different use cases, with hands-on prompts to make the scenarios more concrete and relatable.
