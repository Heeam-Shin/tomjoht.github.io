description: "I'm adding a new section on AI to my API doc course. Currently, there's just 1 article in there (on <a href='/learnapidoc/docapis_oxygenxml_positron_assistant.html'>Oxygen XML Positron Assistant</a>), but I plan to add many more over the coming months."

Some of the articles I have planned include the following:

- Creating AI chat experiences for users
- Using AI to learn and document code
- AI Prompt engineering for docs
- Toward a holy grail of auto-generated documentation generated by AI
- Use AI to create shell scripts to manage and publish docs
- Use AI to fix OpenAPI specification errors
- Create summaries for docs with AI
- Improve search with AI tools
- Use AI to summarize bug threads and resolutions

Any other ideas for me? Let me know. You can see the new section here: [Chapter 15: AI tools and API documentation](/learnapidoc/ai.html).
