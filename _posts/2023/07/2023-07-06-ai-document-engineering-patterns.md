Here's the intro: 

Pattern prompting involves teaching the AI a specific structure or template, then having it populate information into that template. Pattern prompts are similar to few-shot prompts, but in this case, rather than having the language model populate the template with its own information, we'll have it sort and structure a mess of information into the template, thus reducing hallucination and error. 

Pattern prompts are among the most interesting strategies for making requests with language models; this is really where the "engineering" aspect of prompting comes into play. In this case, it's the practice of AI document engineering. By constructing prompts into patterns for the AI to complete, or templates to populate, you'll see the true power of language models emerge. Change your prompt into rules and a template for language models to populate, and the responses will be much better than open-ended questions.

The following sections describe a four step process for AI document engineering. These process involves the following steps: 1. Gather the information, 2. Create rules, 3. Create templates, and 4. Assemble the information into a prompt.
