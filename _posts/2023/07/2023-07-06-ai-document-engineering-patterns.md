description: "I added a new section to my API doc course on pattern-based prompts. Pattern prompting involves teaching the AI a specific structure or template, then having it populate information into that template. Pattern prompts are similar to few-shot prompts, but in this case, rather than having the language model populate the template with its own information, weâ€™ll have it sort and structure a mess of information into the template, thus reducing hallucination and error."
