description: "I'm giving a webinar titled 'Experiments and use cases for AI from a tech writer’s perspective' on December 8, 2023. The webinar is sponsored by the STC Washington, DC - Baltimore Chapter. In this presentation, I’ll share some personal experiences in using AI for different writing-related use cases, explaining what I’ve found helpful. These use cases and takeaways are all experiential, based on my experiments with using AI both in the workplace for documentation-related scenarios and writing on my blog."

> **Experiments and use cases for AI from a tech writer’s perspective**
> 
> Since AI has gone mainstream and promised to transform many professions, including tech comm, many of us have been exploring and experimenting with AI in different use cases. We know it’s important to learn these AI tools, but in what situations do we use AI, and how can AI help? Conversely, in what situations does AI backfire? In this presentation, I’ll share some personal experiences in using AI for different writing-related use cases, explaining what I’ve found helpful. These use cases and takeaways are all experiential, based on my experiments with using AI both in the workplace for documentation-related scenarios and writing on my blog.

You can [register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webinar-experiments-and-use-cases-for-ai-from-a-tech-writers-perspective-tickets-761896822907). (Anyone can attend &mdash; you don't need to be an STC member.)

As usual, I'll also include a recording of the webinar on my blog afterwards. 

## More details

Here's a little more of what I'll be covering. Last month I published a podcast titled [AI and APIs: What works, what doesn't](/blog/ai-apis-what-works-and-doesnt-video-recording-podcast). In that podcast, I tried to describe 10 solid use cases for using AI with documentation, especially API documentation. However, since giving that presentation, I've noticed an increasing attitude of skepticism and apathy toward AI. Whether it's just my social circles or a broader sentiment, I get the sense that people are tired of the hype about AI without seeing more direct application of AI to improve their lives and make their work easier. 

Rather than focus the use cases on documentation, in this presentation I plan to be more informal and explain how, when, and where I'm using AI tools, whether the scenarios relate to documentation scenarios or not. I plan to cover about 20 different use cases. I might also include some hands-on experiments that people can try. (The original request for the webinar was to do more basic handholding through some AI tools.)

In preparation for the presentation, I'd like to hear how you're using AI tools. Feel free to [reach out to me](/contact) with a description of the scenarios you're using AI for.
