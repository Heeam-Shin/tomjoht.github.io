For new users, two of the most important topics in API docs are the product overview and getting started tutorial. These two topics combine conceptual understanding with hands-on exploration. Together, these topics can ground users in a good understanding of your product and the confidence to implement it.

However, both of these topics are challenging. The product overview requires solid understanding of the whole product, described succinctly and clearly. Its content can overlap with marketing content and often has both engineering and business executive audiences. The getting started tutorial requires writers to determine an intricate balance of information -- keeping the instructions brief enough to fit the end-to-end scope but also detailed enough for the user to be successful. The getting started tutorial needs to give the user success in working the product; this confidence will inspire the user to more advanced levels.

In this presentation, you’ll learn best practices, pitfalls, and other strategies for these two content types. Templates for each content type will also be provided. Additionally, we’ll look at several examples and assess them based on more formal criteria.
