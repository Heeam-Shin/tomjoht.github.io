description: "Lately I've been trying trying something that I call <i>life experiments</i>. These are goals that I adopt for about 50 days and then evaluate their impact on my life. So far it's been an interesting experiment. The reason for 50 days is to give the experiment sufficient time to have had an impact. If I keep a experiment for a week or two only, it's hard to see what change it makes."

## Experiment: Change the way I read news

The other week, either as a mistake or a promotion, I received a paper delivery of the Seattle Times on my driveway. It was the first time I'd read a physical newspaper for years. It was novel, enjoyable, almost like making a phone call using a quarter from a phone booth. It made me rethink my existing news-reading habits.

My existing news-reading habits were as follows:

* Pay for digital access to both the New York Times and Seattle Times
* Subscribe to news alerts, filtering them into a "newsletter" category that skips my email inbox but which I periodically check
* Scroll through feeds in the morning while lying in bed
* Read other news on my phone during downtime or times of boredom, often lying in bed as well

I have a Google Pixel phone, and when I swipe left from the home screen, it shows a personalized news feed based on my interests and online searches. So I scan that news as well, though often the articles feel like clickbait and lack depth.

I'm guessing that my existing news-reading habits are mostly the norm these days, but I didn't feel like they were particularly mentally healthy, especially lying in bed clicking article after article. Here's what I didn't like:

* I don't like how personalized newsfeeds amplify my existing lens on the world. If I start reading about X, I see more of X. Pretty soon, my view of the world prominently factors in X everywhere. Personalized news feeds give me a distorted view of the world around me, creating a shape of just what I want to see, reinforcing the news I'm already reading. I prefer more of a less-tracked, less personalized version of world events.

* I don't like lying in bed and clicking links on my phone in an endless way. This easily leads me to click links in more newsbaity publications, and soon I shift from reading the New York Times to Reddit, and my attention is drawn to shortform content that is quirky, bizarre, temporarily jaw-dropping, grotesque, shocking, odd, etc. The worst case of this is Tik Tok, which I don't browse but see my kids browsing. Tik Tok gives you 15 seconds of this type of information ews combined with music until your next hit. I think this habit messes with the brain, rewriting it.

* I also dislike the news alerts delivered to my inbox in various breaking news streams throughout the day. I feel like this creates a state of continuous partial attention, where I'll check my email during a moment of boredom for a hit of news. This takes me out of my normal task flow and keeps me continuously informed about what's going on. As a result, I'm less likely to be immersed and present in whatever activity or task I'm involved in.

With this experiment, to change my news-reading ways, I decided to take a paper subscription for the New York Times. With my wife's academic discount, this works out to $40/month, which is not a price I'm used to paying with the previous digital access. I also canceled my Seattle Times subscription and turned off all news alerts delivered to my email.

Now, when I wake up in the morning, rather than click links on my phone for news, I go down and get the paper from my driveway (even at 5:15 am, it's already delivered). I make coffee and sit down at a small table in my kitchen nook to read the paper. I'm only a few days into this, but so far it seems to be working well. I like that I get out of bed rather than lying there for 30 minutes or more click-scrolling endlessly. I like that the news feels less filtered, and I am becoming more aware of world events in a way that I previously ignored. I'll check back here in a month or two with more commentary and analysis on this experiment.
