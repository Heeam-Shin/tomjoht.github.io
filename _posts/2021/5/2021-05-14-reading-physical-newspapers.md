## My dissatisfaction with existing news reading habits

The other week, either as a mistake or a promotion, I received a paper delivery of the Seattle Times on my driveway. It was the first time I'd read a physical newspaper for years. The expeirence was novel, enjoyable, almost like making a phone call using a quarter from a phone booth. It made me rethink my existing news-reading habits.

My previous news-reading habits were as follows:

* Pay for digital access to both the New York Times and Seattle Times
* Subscribe to news alerts in my email inbox, filtering them into a "newsletter" category that skips my primary inbox but which I periodically check
* Scroll through feeds in the morning while lying in bed
* Read other news on my phone during downtime or times of boredom, often lying in bed as well (before bed or when I wake up)

Additionally, I have a Google Pixel phone, and when I swipe left from the home screen, it shows a personalized news feed based on my interests and online searches. So I scan that news as well, though the articles often feel like clickbait and lack depth.

I'm guessing that my existing news-reading habits are mostly the norm these days, but I didn't feel like they were particularly mentally healthy, especially lying in bed clicking article after article. Here's what I didn't like:

* I didn't like how personalized newsfeeds amplify my existing lens on the world. If I start reading about X, I see more of X. Pretty soon, my view of the world prominently factors in X everywhere. (For example, one time I read a few articles about Jeff Bezos, and then I started seeing him mentioned in articles everywhere, giving me the false impression that he was front news.) Personalized news feeds give me a distorted view of the world around me, creating a shape of supposed topics I want to see and reinforcing the news I'm already reading. I prefer more of a less-tracked, less personalized version of world events. I want an unbiased slate of articles that doesn't try to guess what I'm interested in reading.

* I don't like lying in bed and clicking links on my phone in an endless way. This easily leads to clicking links in more newsbaity publications, and soon I shift from reading the New York Times to Reddit, and my attention is drawn to shortform content that is quirky, bizarre, temporarily jaw-dropping, grotesque, shocking, odd, etc. The worst case of this is Tik Tok, which I don't browse but see my kids browsing. Tik Tok gives you 15 seconds of this type of information news combined with music until your next hit. I think this habit messes with the brain, rewiring it. I also don't like that sense of not wanting to get out of bed and being lured to remain by clicking article after article on my phone.

* I dislike the news alerts delivered to my inbox in various "breaking news" streams throughout the day. I feel like this creates a state of continuous partial attention, where I'll check my email during a moment of boredom for a hit of news. This takes me out of my normal task flow and keeps me continuously informed about what's going on. When news breaks, reporting is often incremental, as more details pile in. I'm less likely to be immersed and present in whatever activity or task I'm involved in.

## Other reasons to reject online news reading

I'm not alone in my criticisms here. In [For Two Months, I Got My News From Print Newspapers. Here’s What I Learned.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html), Farhad Manjoo explains that he switched his news consumption from online + social media to print newspaper and found it lifechanging. He writes:

> This has been my life for nearly two months. In January, after the breaking-newsiest year in recent memory, I decided to travel back in time. I turned off my digital news notifications, unplugged from Twitter and other social networks, and subscribed to home delivery of three print newspapers &mdash; The Times, The Wall Street Journal and my local paper, The San Francisco Chronicle &mdash; plus a weekly newsmagazine, The Economist.
>
> I have spent most days since then getting the news mainly from print, though my self-imposed asceticism allowed for podcasts, email newsletters and long-form nonfiction (books and magazine articles). Basically, I was trying to slow-jam the news &mdash; I still wanted to be informed, but was looking to formats that prized depth and accuracy over speed.

His main argument is that when news breaks, there's a period where details are still cohering and professionals are figuring the whole story out. Yet news organizations, including social media, quickly publish this half-formed news and fill in the details with commentary and opinions, which are often misguided. By "slow-jamming" the news and getting information basically a day later, Manjoo says the stories have had time to harden into a more fact-based, full-pictured story that's much more efficient to consume. You don't get yanked around in different directions while the news media figures out the full details of news.

That is a strong benefit for switching to print newspaper, but it's not the main reason for my experiment. For me, it's the tyranny of the constantly incoming information that annoys me. Manjoo explains that turning off this incoming stream of half-formed news was a gamechanger for him as well:

> It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins. ...
>
> We have spent much of the past few years discovering that the digitization of news is ruining how we collectively process information. Technology allows us to burrow into echo chambers, exacerbating misinformation and polarization and softening up society for propaganda. With artificial intelligence making audio and video as easy to fake as text, we’re entering a hall-of-mirrors dystopia, what some are calling an “information apocalypse.” And we’re all looking to the government and to Facebook for a fix.

Manjoo's comment here is a stronger indichtment of social media. I have noticed that news on social media channels does present more lopsided views of events. For example, I was following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict mainly through the newspaper, but the other night I browsed [reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/) and saw scene after scene of protests against Jewish Zionist atrocities. In the New York Times reports, I was left more to form my own opinion of the events, but some critical commentary did point out political motives on both sides. At any rate, it made me understand a bit more how browsing what's trending on Twitter or Reddit, then reading a dozen or so tweets and opinions/comments on the issue, might not be the best approach for news. Even so, I'm less concerned about the bias of information than the tyranny of continuous news alerts.

I like the idea of timeboxing my intake of news. I don't like continually processing new information as it comes in. I am a compulsive email checker and don't need to see each microdetail of news as it unfolds. It does seem more efficient to have a dedicated news reading time each day.

## The experiment

With this experiment, to change my news-reading ways, I decided to take a paper subscription for the New York Times. With my wife's academic discount, this works out to $40/month, which is not a price I'm used to paying with the previous digital access. I also canceled my Seattle Times subscription and turned off all news alerts delivered to my email.

Now, when I wake up in the morning, rather than click links on my phone for news, I go down and get the paper from my driveway (even at 5:15 am, it's already delivered). I make coffee and sit down at a small table in my kitchen nook to read the paper. I'm only about a week into this experiment, but so far it seems to be working well.

First, I've noticed that it's much easier to get out of bed. Whereas previously, reading articles on my phone would lull me into remaining in bed for 30-45 minutes of waking up, I now perk up and am out of bed within a few minutes or less. My entry into the world is heightened by the idea of getting the newspaper from the driveway and reading the news.

I also like the layout of a physical newspaper. The front page lets me know what's really on the front-page; it's not a display that has been curated by my existing topic searches and reading habits. Additionally, there's a sense of hierarchy to the news, allowing me to see what's more important.

I can also more easily scan print news media. I often just read the first sentence of each paragraph, and then abandon the article when it gets dull. It takes about 30 minutes to get through the paper each morning (though the Sunday edition is 5 times as large).

My kids are fascinated with the comics and crosswords, which is kind of interesting.

I plan to revisit this post in about four more weeks, but already I can tell that the switch to print newspaper has been a good one that I plan to keep.
