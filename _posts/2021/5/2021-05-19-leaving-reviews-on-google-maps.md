The other week I was at Duthie bike park for the first time with a friend who had visited the place more times than he can count. I asked if he'd ever left a review of the place in Google Maps. He paused a minute and said no. Meanwhile, I was thinking about just what I'd say in my review, even as a first-time visitor.

Ever since I started working for Google in the Geo group, I wanted to use Google Maps more and so started interacting more in the reviews section. Prior to this, I'd never thought of leaving reviews either. But as I started leaving reviews of the various places I'd visited, I began to realize a couple of things. First, reviewing places is a lot of fun. Also, I personally rely a lot on reviews, not just within Maps but for products and services I buy as well across the web. Reviews have been a key indicator of nearly every decision, from buying socks to cooking new recipes to scheduling car repairs.

You can see my list of reviews on Google Maps [here](). I have about 80 reviews so far, and I'd like to think many of them are quality reviews. I try to include a photo where possible. Sometimes I'm commenting on the state of something I'm interested in. For example, suppose I go to a park for the purpose of shooting baskets there. If so, I'll focus my review specifically on that. If I'm a first-time visitor to a place, I'll often note that as well.

Reviews give people power. If you decide to review a place negatively, and the place doesn't have many reviews, your negative review can discourage more business to the place. On the other hand, if the place has thousands of existing reviews, one negative review might not mean much. Overall, I tend to leave more inflated reviews of places and to review the place for what it aspires to be, not based on some ideal.

Because so many of my decisions come from reviews, I feel compelled to leave reviews for others. But leaving reviews is also fun, like putting on a critic's hat and evaluating the quality of something.

I've also come to despise websites that distort reviews. For example, I tried leaving reviews on ShowersPass site, only to find that they filtered them out both times. When I wrote them to ask why they filtered my reviews, they said, "".

I recently bought some bathroom faucets on Wayfair. I initially tried to cancel my order, but after they arrived I decided to keep them after all. I tried to leave a review about how to reduce the noisy sound from the aerators, but I found that I couldn't review the item anymore. When I asked Wayfair, they said, "".

Yelp also lost a ton of credibility with their handling and filtering of reviews.

On the other hand, sites like Amazon don't filter reviews out like this (as far as I can tell). Reading a review on Amazon, I feel like I get more honest information, which is one reason why people trust Amazon's brand so much. Google Maps also doesn't filter my reviews, and I feel I can trust the information there as well (I only wish people would leave more of it).
