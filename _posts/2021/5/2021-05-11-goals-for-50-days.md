## Why 50 days

The reason for 50 days is to give the experiment sufficient time to have had an impact. If I keep a experiment for a week or two only, it's hard to evaluate and assess what change it has ultimately made on my life.

## Experiment: Two hours of exercise a day

My first experiment was to exercise for two hours a day. Exercise for this experiment usually means low-impact walking, biking, kicking a soccer ball, or shooting baskets. (High intensity exercise for two hours each day would likely result in injury.) I coupled this experiment with some weight-loss goals in an effort to get back in shape in anticipation of post-covid sports freedom, but my weight-loss efforts sort of petered out after a bit.

I did, however, notice that the increased daily exercise had a positive impact on my well-being. I felt more active, more alive, and more healthy. I noticed that if I didn't get this exercise, my legs started to become eager to walk around. At my kids' soccer games, rather than sit down to watch, I now prefer to walk around, even if it's just back and forth along the sidelines. I become restless otherwise.

My wife enjoys walking, especially hiking, so we've been going out more for these walks, as well as after-dinner walks. My kids like to go on bike rides or forays to the park as well, which I'm ready to do especially knowing that it will help get my exercise minutes in.

I realized that I've been blogging less as a result of this goal, as this does require more time, but it's outdoor time. I very well could spend this time at home, sitting on the couch watching TV. In fact, sometimes at night, to get the required minutes in, I just walk around the block while watching a show on my phone.

After the 50 days, I decided to keep this goal/experiment. I don't want to return to the more sedentary lifestyle. I like the way my body feels with a more active lifestyle.

I did realize that I needed to make some more refinements to what counts as two hours. Two hours of exercise can differ dramatically in intensity, calories burned, and body wear-and-tear depending on the activity. Walking slowly versus mountain biking versus wogging (walk+jogging) versus active soccer versus other activities have different levels of physical impact. It's not fair to equate a long walk with mountain biking straight upside a hill. So how do you account for the difference in a meaningful yet still simple way?

I do use trackers (e.g., MapMyRide, Strava, Google Fit, Fitbit) to attempt to track my activity, but these trackers work best with only straightforward walking or jogging. If you're shooting baskets, kicking a soccer ball and moving randomly about a field, or mountain biking in a hilly area, the trackers can be uselessly inaccurate. For example, if I choose "Hike" in MapMyRide instead of Walk, on my mild wilderness trail hike (no pack), it says I burn about 800 calories instead of 300. Between my wife's iPhone and my Pixel, there's regularly a difference of a half a mile in the distance walked.

I'm still trying to figure out the best tracker. I do think Google Fit's estimations for walking and biking seem the most realistic, and it even counts my forays into the supermarket as a calorie-burning activity. However, Google Fit also assigns points earned to give you a more realist picture of the heart-healthy impact of the exercise. For example:

I think either 60 points *or* 2 hours seems like a good rule of thumb. That means if I decide to pick up the pace and wog more, I can finish my exercise in less time. In contrast, if the two hours is a static rule, there's not much incentive to do more aggressive physical activity.

However, Google Fit (which assigns the points) doesn't always capture every activity. For example, my latest mountain biking ride doesn't seem to have registered. Sometimes Google Fit asks me if my activity involved even riding a bike on the road, as if it's unsure how to interpret the motion.

Overall, I'd probably be better off manually estimating and rating the handful of activities I regularly do. I only really do several things: walk, bike on the road, bike on a trail, shoot baskets, soon also play basketball, kick a soccer ball, and wog.

## Experiment: Change the way I read news

The other week, either as a mistake or a promotion, I received a paper delivery of the Seattle Times on my driveway. It was the first time I'd read a physical newspaper for years. It was novel, enjoyable, almost like making a phone call using a quarter from a phone booth. It made me rethink my existing news-reading habits.

My existing news-reading habits were as follows:

* Pay for digital access to both the New York Times and Seattle Times
* Subscribe to news alerts, filtering them into a "newsletter" category that skips my email inbox but which I periodically check
* Scroll through feeds in the morning while lying in bed
* Read other news on my phone during downtime or times of boredom, often lying in bed as well

I have a Google Pixel phone, and when I swipe left from the home screen, it shows a personalized news feed based on my interests and online searches. So I scan that news as well, though often the articles feel like clickbait and lack depth.

I'm guessing that my existing news-reading habits are mostly the norm these days, but I didn't feel like they were particularly mentally healthy, especially lying in bed clicking article after article. Here's what I didn't like:

* I don't like how personalized newsfeeds amplify my existing lens on the world. If I start reading about X, I see more of X. Pretty soon, my view of the world prominently factors in X everywhere. Personalized news feeds give me a distorted view of the world around me, creating a shape of just what I want to see, reinforcing the news I'm already reading. I prefer more of a less-tracked, less personalized version of world events.

* I don't like lying in bed and clicking links on my phone in an endless way. This easily leads me to click links in more newsbaity publications, and soon I shift from reading the New York Times to Reddit, and my attention is drawn to shortform content that is quirky, bizarre, temporarily jaw-dropping, grotesque, shocking, odd, etc. The worst case of this is Tik Tok, which I don't browse but see my kids browsing. Tik Tok gives you 15 seconds of this type of information ews combined with music until your next hit. I think this habit messes with the brain, rewriting it.

* I also dislike the news alerts delivered to my inbox in various breaking news streams throughout the day. I feel like this creates a state of continuous partial attention, where I'll check my email during a moment of boredom for a hit of news. This takes me out of my normal task flow and keeps me continuously informed about what's going on. As a result, I'm less likely to be immersed and present in whatever activity or task I'm involved in.

With this experiment, to change my news-reading ways, I decided to take a paper subscription for the New York Times. With my wife's academic discount, this works out to $40/month, which is not a price I'm used to paying with the previous digital access. I also canceled my Seattle Times subscription and turned off all news alerts delivered to my email.

Now, when I wake up in the morning, rather than click links on my phone for news, I go down and get the paper from my driveway (even at 5:15 am, it's already delivered). I make coffee and sit down at a small table in my kitchen nook to read the paper. I'm only a few days into this, but so far it seems to be working well. I like that I get out of bed rather than lying there for 30 minutes or more click-scrolling endlessly. I like that the news feels less filtered, and I am becoming more aware of world events in a way that I previously ignored. I'll check back here in a month or two with more commentary and analysis on this experiment.

## Goal 3: Vocabulary....
