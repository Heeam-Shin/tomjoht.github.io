As a senior technical writer, I've been focused more on tackling "ambiguous" content, as opposed to unambiguous content that is more commonly assigned to non-senior technical writers. I wasn't entirely sure what was meant by ambiguous content, but this has come into focus more over the past few months. Here I'd like to pinpoint exactly what this means, as it helps identify content that has characteristics I've encountered for years.

Ambiguous content has one or more of the following characteristics:

* The content lacks a clear owner, nor does the content doesn't map to a single product team.
* The product crosses teams, with multiple co-owners/contributors and contact points.
* The content doesn't map to an upcoming release. The content is essential but easy to neglect, like a product overview or a getting started tutorial.
* The content lacks sufficient information and resources as a starting point. You need more information, but it doesn't exist anywhere and the most relevant team for the info has disbanded, moved on, or is not forthcoming in detail, not the right resource, etc.
* The strategy for the content is unclear and needs to be defined. For example, the deliverable for the content might be unclear, as well as the length.
* The people who need to approve the content is a senior level, hard to track down, and has an impossibly busy schedule. When you do track them down, you find they have a lot of strong thoughts on nearly every detail.
* The content is extremely difficult to test on your own without a lot of setup, hardware, tooling, access, or engineering know-how. This leaves tech writers more reliant on the engineer's word for the content's accuracy.
* The content has multiple challenging requirements, such as gated access, PDF output, content re-use, localization, personalization with variables, or conditional content. The system you're using for authoring/publishing might pose challenges for some of these features.
* Little is known about the users, their needs, their friction points, etc.; also,  contacting the users is restricted. This leaves writers somewhat in the dark in trying to write to the user.
* The content builds on another content set, but adding or modifying practices in various ways; as such, the content itself lacks the full story and appears as piecemeal, standalone articles that assume knowledge is defined elsewhere.

If your team consists of junior technical writers, technical writers, and senior technical writers, consider using this identification of ambiguous content as you divide up tasks for the senior technical writer.

Also note that every unambigious content, which doesn't appear to have these characteristics on the surface, often show these traits as the project progresses.
