description: "I added a new article in my API doc course called <a href='/learnapidoc/docapis_release_process.html'>Ensuring documentation coverage with each software release</a>. Getting a good handle on your release process -- such as understanding the cadence of releases, how features are tracked and tagged in different phases, and other checkpoints prior to the release signoff -- is central to thriving in any documentation role. Providing doc coverage for each release ensures you don't accrue documentation debt, and it boosts user satisfaction for the new features being released. This article adds to about a dozen other process-oriented articles in the <a href='learnapidoc/docapis_managing_doc_processes.html'>processes and methodology section</a>."
