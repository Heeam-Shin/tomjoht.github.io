description: "This post is mostly about shoes (and the way the shoe industry has gone awry), but it's not entirely unrelated to technical writing. Technical writing is a sedentary career that involves sitting all day. As such, it's easy to develop bad posture and other physical problems. If you're new to the tech writing career, you might not experience the effects if sitting all day at first, but add 20 years of this, and you'll probably experience some issues. Almost all of have physical ailment of some kind. In this post, I argue that shoes with heel wedges might be to blame. Heel-wedged shoes shorten and atrophy our calf muscles and imbalance our posture, leading to back pain and other issues. I share my story of why I got into wearing minimal shoes and how I've reconciled basketball playing with the natural movement."

## How I started getting into the shoespiracy topic

A few months ago, I wrote a post called [Trying to back back to normal](/blog/trying-to-get-back-to-normal) where I described my attempts to resume playing basketball after a year-long hiatus with the pandemic. I've been playing basketball since I was a kid, but for the past 5 years I've suffered recurring calf strains that have required a lot of time off court to rest and heal. Every couple of months, I tend to strain the calf again and have to sit out for 3-4 weeks to allow it to heal. I've been to numerous physical therapists and couldn't figure out what the underlying problem was.

Fed up with physical therapists, about six months ago I visited a chiropractor who specializes in Active Release therapy (ART), and he performed some magic massage on my calf muscles (a technique that involves pinning and stretching) that seemed to have good success. After a few ART sessions on my calves, I thought he had fixed the muscle issues and that I would be all good, but after a couple of months of playing, I strained my calf once again, and then again, and then again. However, these times, the calf strains happened in different parts of my calf than before, which confused me.

Added to this, I also started experiencing hamstring pain due to friction on my sciatic nerve (not on the same leg with the problematic calf), and I started having patellofemoral syndrome (misalignment of the knee cap) with my knee. I wondered if I'd perhaps come to the end of my basketball playing days. I am, after all, 46 years old. Maybe I'd simply worn my legs and knees out?

I tried biking more, and thought perhaps I could replace basketball with cycling. But the knee pain from the patellofemoral syndrome would kick in after about 5 miles of cycling, and so this blocked me more immersion with the bike. Plus, my preference was basketball more than biking anyway.

One of the perks of working at Google is to have a physical therapist (PT) right in the same building where I work, so last month I ventured down and decided to see if the PT had any insights for me. I explained that I had three recent calf strains in different parts of the calf; it felt like something structural was wrong. He said I had some anterior pelvic tilt and rib flare, which led to some incorrect posture. He said I had too much curvature in my lower back and needed to push out my lower back more. He gave me a series of exercises that would help correct this. He also identified some weak muscles in my legs that needed strengthening, and said I was overusing my knees rather than relying more on my glutes for power.

He also recommended that I look into zero-drop shoes for basketball. I'd never heard of zero-drop shoes before because I'm not a runner and hadn't known much about the barefoot running movement, but the recommendation for zero-drop shoes set me on course for cult-like education and awakening like nothing I've ever experienced.

## Zero-drop shoes

A good deal of my posture issues can be attributed to the shoes you wear. "Zero-drop" refers to the drop in height from the heel to the toe, with zero-drop having no change in height. In contrast, most shoes have a wedged heel, elevating it more than the toe. To try out zero-drop shoes, I ordered a pair of [Prio shoes from Xero shoes](https://xeroshoes.com) and immediately fell in love with them.

Not only are the shoes zero-drop, they also have a wide toe box, which gives your toes room to spread. And they also have a minimal sole, allowing your foot to feel the ground. Zero-drop shoes are closely associated with the barefoot running movement, which use minimalist shoes to simulate running barefoot. Wearing these shoes for just 2 weeks has led to two major realizations.

## Realization 1: Wedged-heel shoes messed up my posture

[barefoot shoes]

Wearing the zero-drop shoes, I immediately noticed a change in my posture. Rather than leaning back, I actually started using more correct posture because of the zero-drop heel. It's difficult to describe, so here's a picture that represents the changes in posture that I feel happened (in a slightly exaggerated way):

[posture pic]

Wearing wedged-heel shoes, my hips tilted forward a bit. To offset that forward hip tilt, I would lean back a bit for balance. As I leaned back, this created a hyper curvature in my lower back. Standing for long periods of time with wedged-heel shoes would frequently make my lower back hurt.

When I removed the heel wedge, my posture naturally adjusted to more of a straightened back. I noticed that wearing zero-drop shoes, my back didn't hurt anymore. I could stand more easily for long periods of time. I haven't adopted a standing desk or anything, but the change in posture is definitely noticeable and the reduction of lower back pain was practically immediate for me.

## Realization #2: Wedged-heel shoes created more heel striking in my gait  

My second realization is that I was a heel striker while playing basketball (running up and down the court). I'm not a runner, so the whole language of heel-striking and mid-striking isn't foremost in my mind. But as I ran in zero-drop shoes (for short durations &mdash; about a minute), I realized that my running form changed. I started to naturally prefer more of a mid-strike (landing in the middle of the foot) rather than a heel-strike (landing on the heel).

In contrast, wearing wedged-heel shoes, as I ran I would naturally use more of a heel-strike motion because the heel sticks out more and naturally hits the ground first. The heel-strike sent more shockwaves up my knee, which I think contributed to my patellofemoral pain.

The idea of barefoot running is that when you run barefoot, you adopt a proper running form. Wearing a minimal shoe, you avoid a running gait that hurts (e.g., heel-striking). You naturally adopt a more mid-strike to your run to avoid pain.

I changed my gait to not only mid-strike, but also to pull my feet up under me and take more steps. Steven Sonder, founder of Xero Shoes, describes the motion like pulling your feet up as if you were stung by a bee. Shorter steps, mid-stroke, and pulling up on the foot were how I started running with the minimal shoes.

## Zero-drop shoes and basketball

Although I think minimalist shoes work fine for most activities, when it comes to basketball, I'm still not courageous enough to wear them. Basketball has a lot of jumping, cutting, pivoting, and other lateral moves. Also, my feet haven't strengthened enough to the point where I'd feel comfortable to play in minimalist shoes without injury. I've only been wearing minimal shoes for two weeks.

However, even wearing normal basketball shoes, I started to adopt the same mid-strike gait and quick, pulling steps that I used when running in the minimalist shoes. As I did, I noticed that I didn't have as much knee pain or leg soreness as I did previously when playing basketball.

At some point, maybe in six months or so (once my feet have strengthened), I might try to graduate to more zero-drop shoes to play. I did order some Altra Solstice XTs based on the recommendations in this article from Correcttoes.com, [Basketball and Natural Footwear Options](https://www.correcttoes.com/foot-help/basketball-series-all-about-shoes-by-andrew-wojciechowski-nd/), but they haven't arrived yet, and they're still a long way from the more supportive design of basketball shoes.

(By the way, most Altra shoes I've explored &mdash; for example, the Altra Lone Peak shoes &mdash; are zero drop and have a wide toe box. They also have more cushioning than some other minimalist shoe, making them extremely comfortable. They're a compelling option, but I didn't want too much cushioning because I needed the feedback from the ground in case my gait or strike wasn't correct.)

Even though I'm still wearing regular basketball shoes, I think that as long as I wear minimalist shoes everywhere else, the brief time in basketball shoes won't roll back my other gains. I'm still searching for a good basketball shoe with a lower heel wedge, but so far, it's like searching for a purple unicorn. The basketball industry emphasizes a design with massive heal wedges, which tilt players down into more of a forward motion. Maybe this forward tilt suits the body's motion during game play, but it also encourages more weight to be positioned over your knees and affects your posture, including your shot.

The Correct Toes article I referenced above does acknowledge that almost no basketball shoes meet the criteria for minimalist shoes. They say, "we understand there arenâ€™t any ideal athletic shoes out there that have been able to merge the concepts of natural foot health with basketball performance." And then they recommend some basketball shoes that seem to embrace some minimalist shoe principles.

## My theory about calf strains

It's still too early to tell whether zero-drop shoes will cure my recurring calf strains. Like I said, I've only been wearing them for about 2 weeks. However, I have a theory about what happened to my calves. Wearing wedged-heel shoes pretty much all my life, my calf muscle shortened and atrophied. When I would play basketball, the jumping and other gameplay movements would at times stress my calf muscle, and because my calf muscle was shortened/atrophied through wedged-heel shoes, it couldn't stand the strain. A healthy calf muscle allows your ankle to bend and flex more.

As a result, I try to wear minimal shoes everywhere I can, even when riding my bike. I swapped out my pedals for some Look flat platform pedals, and this seems to be working. My work commute isn't that far (~ 2 miles on a bike currently). However, there's a lot of time spent walking up and down stairs in train stations, waiting or standing on the train, and more. So I wanted to reap the benefits of minimal shoes as much as possible. (Even in the rain, I don't find the pedals that slippery.)

## Toe spreading

Ideally, I'd like to find some zero-drop basketball shoes, even if they have a strong cushion. In looking for zero-drop basketball shoes, I also realized something else: most basketball shoes have narrow toe boxes. Wearing the Prio shoes for two weeks, I noticed that my feet started to spread a bit, which is what's supposed to happen. Toes aren't supposed to be narrow and close together; they're instead supposed to be like the fingers on your hand that spread out.

After playing basketball in my Lebron 16s, I started getting a blister on my big toe. My second toe is about 1/4 inch longer than my big toe, and its toenail is simply black from being crammed in traditional shoes all the time. So I looked for some basketball shoes that have cloth in the toe area and are as wide as possible. I also sized up from a 13 to 14. I am currently wearing Giannis Immortality shoes and find them to be great.

## Once you switch, it's hard to go back

Once you make the switch to zero-drop shoes, it's hard to wear anything else. When you put on any other shoes, it feels like wearing high-heel shoes. And every time I have to put on shoes with a wedge, I feel like I'm regressing with the healing of my feet and calves. I'm still early into my minimalist footwear journey, but I wanted to share it here. If this switch truly proves to fix my recurring calf strain issue, then my disillusion with the shoe industry will grow stronger. Already, I am constantly noticing the degree of heel-to-toe drop in everyone's shoes around me. Fortunately, my kids are into Converse and Vans, which both have near zero-drop (but narrow toe boxes).
