Balancing tasks and concepts

Ideas such as minimalism (as defined by John Carroll, Hans van der mer, and others) as well as research about opportunistic learning behaviors encourage much more action-oriented approaches to tech writing, with getting started tutorials, interactive features like Swagger UI, code you can run directly on the page, and a healthy dose of tasks, tasks, and more tasks. It seems like researchers have been reiterating the belief that users, almost universally, are "reading to do" and are anxious to get going with tasks and other hands-on exploration. *Enough with the lengthy explanations &mdash; get to the the task at hand so the user can finish their work!*

At the same time, documentation often fails to tell the who/what/when/why about the product. Overview pages provide little detail about what the product even is before jumping directly into how to configure it and install it. I don't know how many GitHub product landing pages I've read that give almost no indication about what the code actually does beyond a one-line cursory note. Many of the problems with documentation involve the absence of a larger story around the product, the connecting pieces that tie all the components together into some kind of cohesive arc. Overview pages are often missing or substituted by a list of articles in the section rather than actual overviews. Documentation that skips these conceptual details and jumps directly into the tasks fails to inform the user.

How do you balance this tension between action and narration about the larger product story? Are these two opposing sides of the tech writing spectrum? When do you focus on reading to do versus reading to understand?

In general, documentation best practices would mean accounting for both mindsets and orientations. For the reading to do mindset, provide these three topics:

- Getting started tutorial
- Sample apps
- Troubleshooting

For the reading to understand mindset, provide these three topics:

- Overview
- User journeys
- ?
