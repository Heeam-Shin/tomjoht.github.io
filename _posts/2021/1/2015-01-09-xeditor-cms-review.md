## Easy-to-use XML editing

[Xeditor](https://www.xpublisher.com/products/xeditor){:rel="nofollow"} is an easy-to-use XML editor which allows authors to use and work with structured content regardless of their XML knowledge. It offers a visual user interface similar to Microsoft Word: Table of contents, footnotes, references, links, diagrams, tables (CALS & HTML) and other media elements such as images or videos can be easily inserted into a document via drag and drop.

A formula editor allows for the integration of complex equations. Find & replace functionality works for both content and structural elements such as attributes. However, Xeditor also provides users with a technical authoring mode. Technical writers have the choice between the well-known tag view mode or the raw XML editor. The editor also supports the standards of each industry, such as DITA, S1000D, DocBook, JATS, etc.

## From Desktop to Web

Xeditor is a web-based editor, which means no time-consuming installation is needed. Although this is not a "new feature," easy access from a web browser is something that has become more valued and given a greater priority by technical writers and companies alike. Especially during last year and the COVID-19-related lockdowns, organizations have had to rethink their digitalization strategies and provide better solutions for remote working. For some, this has also meant switching from desktop to web infrastructures.

Being able to work on your XML content from anywhere may seem like an obvious benefit; however, there are not many professional web-based solutions available. With Xeditor you can access all XML documents anytime anywhere through your web browser and easily collaborate with other authors. You are even able to continue your work when the internet connection is unexpectedly interrupted. Changes will automatically be saved in your browser and transmitted with the next synchronization.

## In-depth collaboration

Another major advantage of Xeditor's web-based architecture is the fact that documents are managed centrally. Your changes and comments are automatically tracked and visible in the text as well as in the XML structure to all users. Authors can comment, mark other author's comments as read, accept or reject them, and edit or add to their text as much as they like. The "lazy loading" feature ensures smooth viewing and editing for large documents. Version comparisons are therefore a thing of the past &mdash; giving you more time to concentrate on content.

## Conclusion

Overall, Xeditor is an easy-to-use editor that enables everyone in your company to work with structured content &mdash; without any knowledge of the underlying XML. The last year has shown us that we have to rethink the way we work. This web-based editor allows both a professional technical writer and other content creators less familiar with XML author and edit structured content, from anywhere at any time. This makes Xeditor an essential tool for content collaboration.
