description: "I added a new article in my API doc course about how to use Oxygen XML in a docs-as-code workflow. <a href='https://www.oxygenxml.com/' rel='nofollow'>Oxygen XML</a> is a robust authoring and publishing tool for technical content that allows you to author in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, or XML) as well as publish to multiple outputs (HTML-based webhelp, PDF, and more). Although traditionally used for XML authoring and publishing, Oxygen XML has expanded its support with Markdown files, especially with the DITA's recent support for Lightweight Markdown. In this new article, you'll learn more about Oxygen XML, different workflows you can use to publish in a docs-as-code model, Git integration with Oxygen XML, supported Markdown formats, how to get started, and more. (Note that this is a sponsored post.) Read more here: <a href='/learnapidoc/pubapis_oxygenxml.html'>Using Oxygen XML with docs-as-code workflows</a>."
