Sometimes I forget that the purpose of a blog is to be a journal of sorts, a web log. In my earlier blogging days, I would pound out an entry in an hour and publish it, whereas now I sometimes think I need more lengthy, thought-out posts. Sometimes I just want to write about everything that's going on and reflect a bit on it. More than anything else, writing has been a tool for reflection for me, a way to sort out and organize my thoughts, to put onto paper the ideas swimming in my head so that I can see them externally.

What exactly is swimming in my head? Not much. The move to Washington was a good one. I absolutely love the area and neighborhood we moved into. I mentioned earlier that I grew up in Washington but moved out after high school. Returning to the area feels a bit like coming home after traveling the world.

The other week my youngest daughter had a soccer game in Mount Vernon, which is right next to the city of Burlington where I grew up. Burlington is a small town in a dairy valley about an hour below the Canadian border. The area sits next to the Skagit River and, once you get outside the valley and farmlands, runs right into the Cascade mountains. Everything is so green and often wet. It rains (more like drizzles) a lot, and the temperatures are cool. It's a moderate climate that suits me perfectly. One of my daughters loves that she can wear sweaters every day. For me, I like wearing warm cardigans.

Driving up to Skagit Valley for the soccer game sent me thinking and reflecting on my childhood. After the soccer game, we drove by the houses where I grew up. This is my childhood home:

I looked up one of my childhood friends on Facebook to see what had become of him, and was surprised to see that he never left the general area. We both went to the same K-through-8th school, but after 8th grade, I ended up moving to Tacoma, a much larger city below Seattle, about 1.5 hours south of Burlington. In contrast, he stayed in Burlington.

As I perused his Facebook page and pictures (we now look so old), I started wondering about the path my life took, and why I bounced around so many places during the past 30 years, whereas he stayed put in Burlington. What is it that took me out of Burlington and around so many different areas of the world?

My parents divorced when I was 10, and for several years I bounced back and forth between their separate houses before job circumstances required them to move more distantly apart. There aren't that many jobs in Burlington. My mom, an occupational therapist, found work in Tacoma, and she had to move there to survive financially. (A few years later, my dad would get a job in Olympia -- even farther than Tacoma -- and commute by motorcycle there before eventually moving to Issaquah.)

My parents were always amicable after the divorce, so as a child there wasn't a lot of emotional conflict. They let me choose where I wanted to go and when, and my mom often drove me back and forth to my Dad's house (a small mobile home in a trailer park). But about a year after my mom moved to Tacoma, the prospect of going to a new city excited me, and I made the jump after graduating from eighth grade.

In Tacoma, I became friends with another kid in an apartment complex where we lived. The kid happened to be Mormon, and that's how I ended up becoming a Mormon in my youth. My mom (who never joined) felt like the youth program in the Mormon church was a good environment for me, as it provided friends, male leaders who were sort of a surrogate father, and a wholesome value system (no drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, etc.).

In Tacoma, I also joined another group of friends through a group called Explorer Search and Rescue, or ESAR. This was a volunteer group that looked for people who got lost in the wilderness (this was before cell phones with GPS), and we had to be ready at a moment's notice to go to some remote location and look for lost people. We had to have a fully stocked backpack that could sustain us for 48 hours.

My ESAR group of friends became my close friends (closer than the Mormon friends), and it was my good luck that they were also high-performing students. I ended up also increasing my grades. In Burlington, my GPA had always been around 3.2 or 3.3 (Bs and As), but in Tacoma I had one semester where I earned a perfect 4.0, and after that kept my grades similarly high. Being surrounded by my nerdy ESAR friends really helped.

Most good Mormons aspire to go to BYU in Utah, and that's where I ended up going to college. I had a motorcycle at the time and actually rode it out to Provo after a roundabout tour through Montana, Colorado, and Texas. After a year at BYU, I served a two-year mission (like most male Mormons) in Venezuela, and then returned to BYU to finish college. I got married (to a rebel), graduated with a degree in English (in the Honors program), and then decided to teach English in Japan for a summer before returning to a creative writing program in New York City to earn an MFA in literary nonfiction.

After the first year in New York, I was lucky enough to receive a graduate teaching assistant fellowship during Columbia (otherwise, I would have never been able to repay the student loans). We had our first child in New York, and about 9 months later 9-11 happened. We were living in the Bronx when all the events took place. I think these events piqued some interest in the middle east.

In college, I thought I would pursue teaching composition at a junior college. I applied to around 80 positions and wasn't considered for any of them, but there was an opportunity to teach at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. They had an office in New York City, where I interviewed. Nearly three months after the interview, I got the job and we packed our belongings and moved to Egypt for the next couple of years.

Egypt was a cultural experience I'll never forget, and one of the highlights of our lives. My wife is a travel bug, and we explored so many areas of the city and country -- trips down the Nile, explorations in the city bazaars, trips to pyramids and ancient cities with hieroglyphs, and more. But I realized a couple of things as a teacher: first, I didn't particularly like teaching. And second, it was a dead-end job. Unless you have a PhD in academia, you end up teaching lower-level writing courses all your life, and grading students essays always made me grumpy. The comments I wrote were mainly geared towards justifying the low grade, and I didn't see students writing improve much. Plus, I wanted to be the one writing. I didn't want to be a writing coach.

We left Egypt and I returned to the US, but not to Washington or Utah or New York. Instead, we moved to Florida because that's where my family had moved (for retirement), and my sister's husband was in tech and we thought we'd have good job opportunities through his connections. This turned out to be right -- through those connections, I landed a job as a marketing copywriter for an alternative nutrition company. I learned that I had a lot of writing energy and channeled all that energy into copy of all sorts, from newsletter articles to press releases, product label copy, web pages, and more. Interestingly enough, the company's main challenges were around SEO -- they wanted to bury some bad press that the CEO, a Scientologist, had received after his involvement with a patient death where medical treatment had been withheld.

The marketing copywriter job didn't pay much. I started at 32k/year and moved up to 33k/year after six months. To stay afloat, I also started teaching writing at ITT-Tech, a now defunct technical college that mostly targeted post-military people to help them get into tech careers. One day while driving from my copywriter job to my side teaching job, stuck in slow traffic across the Causeway bridge, I had a financial "reality check" moment/breakdown in which I cursed myself for being so foolish as to major in English (rather than accounting or something more marketable). It was at that point that I decided to switch careers into technical writing.

When I was in Egypt, one of my close colleagues told me I would be a perfect technical writer. He had been a tech writer for a few years prior to teaching. I created interactive websites to accompany my courses, and my colleague saw some technical aptitude that he thought would make me suited to writing in tech (even though he himself hated tech writing).

I gathered up all my writing samples from my marketing copywriting job and applied at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. As luck would have it, my interviewer had a PhD in Biology. She looked at one of my samples -- a detailed explanation of protein, how it works, and why it's essential (it was educational content for some protein pills the company sold), and she thought my explanation was solid. This landed me my first job as a technical writer.

Through a supportive team of about a dozen tech writers, I learned the basics of tech writing. I remember being surprised that procedures needed to be described in such exacting detail. You couldn't just write that some task needed to be done, but you had to enumerate each of the steps in the task with exacting detail. I was like, *really?*

The pay was much better at Raymond James. My starting salary was 40k the first year, and then jumped up to 50k the next. I also got involved in the Suncoast STC chapter, which was a great network for the technical writing community. One seasoned technical writer took me under his wing and helped me feel a connection and belonging to the community. I volunteered as webmaster and refactored the chapter website using WordPress. I wanted the chapter to participate in a group blog, with many of the chapter members contributing posts. It was right around this time (2006) that blogging was becoming popular. After a month of not getting others to write, and realizing that the chapter blog was mostly just me writing posts, I decided to create my own blog. This was when idratherbewriting.com got started.

Life was good in Florida -- we had two more children and bought a house. But we made a terrible decision about the location of the house. We bought a new house in a drug neighborhood, and there were constant drug deals and shootouts. One week, during a shootout in a back alley behind our house, a stray bullet entered our daughter's room right above her crib. The next week we were robbed. We decided to move to a safer, more family friendly area. We sold our house at a loss and moved to Utah, where my wife's family lived.

In Utah, I worked first at a remote government facility in Dugway (two hours out to the Western desert) documenting storage arrays (which I knew nothing about). And when that job seemed unstable -- they were never sure if the government would renew the contract -- I switched to working as a tech writer for the Mormon church. I was still Mormon at the time, so this seemed like a dream job. And it was -- I worked with friendly colleagues, learned Flare and InDesign, and honed my skills there for about five years. I had freedom and flexibility to innovate, and I continued to write on my blog the whole time. Then one day in 2013, there was a huge layoff, with about 12% of the group let go, including the entire tech pubs team. (I wrote about this in my series [Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off](/blog/reflecting-seven-years-later-about-layoff-intro/)).

Fortunately, the Church was generous with the layoff severance package. I'd always wanted to go to California and be in the center of tech -- Silicon Valley -- so we made our way out to the Bay area. We tried to sell our house, but the market wasn't good enough, so we just contracted with a local management agency to rent it out.

In California, most of the jobs required more advanced technical skills than I possessed, but to my good fortune, a top recruiter in the area was a fan of my blog. He persuaded a company to hire me even though I didn't really have a strong knowledge of JavaScript. They trusted the recruiter, and the recruiter trusted me because of the podcasts and other content from my blog. It turned out to be a perfect job for me. I learned API documentation at this job and loved the whole gamification domain.

I would have stayed for years at this company, but it was a startup, and the company was struggling to stay afloat. New CEOs were constantly brought in to fix the financials, all while employees were jumping ship or being laid off on a weekly basis. Having just been laid off in Utah not too long ago, I was wary about being stranded and jobless in an expensive area like the Bay, and so when another opportunity arose, I took it. It was another API documentation job, this one covering much more than JavaScript. The APIs were packaged into SDKs for Java, PHP, C++, Android, and iOS. I was really swimming in code and had a hard time keeping the languages straight.

During this time, my wife became increasingly disillusioned with the Mormon church. I had four girls now, and it was clear that growing up in the Mormon church wasn't good for women, as it encouraged a career trajectory toward motherhood and second-class citizenship as members. I had cooled off as well and felt disconnected with the Mormon community for years -- they weren't curious or open-minded, and I didn't fit in well anymore. One day we decided to cut our ties and abandon the faith.

This was a little uncomfortable because my manager at the time was also Mormon, but in another city. Although this company had more stability (it was a startup acquired by a larger company), my recruiter friend told me I could be making a lot more than I currently was. I didn't really believe him, but I decided to apply to a larger tech company (Amazon) to see if it was true. During my interview process, I was fortunate to have another blog reader on my side from the start, and I got the job. During the interview process, the interviewer told me that the ideas I expressed in a certain blog post perfectly aligned with what they were looking for. And the recruiter was right -- I was offered a salary that had a 30% bump up from what I was currently making. I couldn't refuse a salary increase like that.

Working at Amazon was a great decision, and I also had a ton of freedom and flexibility to innovate in my role. I spent five years at Amazon and deepened my knowledge of APIs, processes, products, and more. I learned how big tech companies work. I also developed my API documentation course ([/learnapidoc/](/learnapidoc/)), after being asked to give more API workshops to surrounding groups and companies in the area. I started being seen and recognized as an expert in API documentation. Many other writers were feeling the squeeze toward more technical jobs, and my focus on APIs provided content perfectly suited to this trend.

I think I could have worked at Amazon for the rest of my life, as I was quite content there. As with all jobs, there were pros and cons. But I built up a great rapport with our devrel team, I created our authoring system, theme, and workflow using docs-as-code tools, and I felt comfortable with the products. However, I was getting tired of being a renter. This is the unfortunate fact of living in California. The houses cost more than a million dollars, so most people end up renting. Each month we paid $3k to $4k in rent, with no growing equity. Additionally, financial incentives at big companies start to fizzle out after four years, and people like to see a variety of companies on resumes. So I decided to explore new opportunities.

During our 8 years in California, equity in the Utah house gradually increased and eventually, we had enough for a sizable down payment on another house. We felt it was time to leave California and find a place where we could settle down for the rest of our lives. My wife wanted to move to Oregon, where her sister lives, and she envisioned me working permanently from home. I didn't think companies would switch to a permanent WFH model after the pandemic, and I liked going to work anyway. I petitioned that Washington would be more suitable because of its proximity to several big tech companies. I interviewed with Google and found a team in Seattle working with maps that looked appealing. We bought a house in Renton that turned out to be a perfect place for us, in a beautiful home overlooking a small creek that flows through the backyard. We're surrounded by green but aren't too far from Seattle to commute in.

When I think about the twists and turns of my life and career, I wonder what forces take me too and fro in the sea of life. While I was watching my youngest play soccer at a field in Skagit valley, right near where I grew up, I thought about my childhood friend who never left the area, who took such a different path through life than me. What uprooted me from the area, what helped me land this job and that, what prompted me to move from one state to the next? I feel like I've traveled the world and had good success in my career.

One constant thread throughout my life has been writing. I think a lot of doors opened for me through my blog. If someone reads my blog and likes my writing/thoughts, they're won over even before the interview process. But also, the focus on writing combined with the task of supporting a family steered me into tech writing for financial sustainability. This career in tech steered me into more urban environments where jobs were available. I couldn't have remained in Burlington and have been a tech writer -- there aren't jobs for tech writers there. Jobs and financial sustainability pushed and pulled me into different places, with different companies. You can't climb a financial ladder by remaining at the same company all your life; equally, I like experiencing and exploring new environments.

Even as a tech writer, I could have stayed in Washington my entire life. I could have gone to a local college, earned a degree in writing and then have worked for Microsoft or Amazon in a writing path, climbing the ladder locally. But I didn't have this career trajectory early on. I didn't find myself on this path until many years after college, similar to many others who meander into technical writing. And I did want to see the world and experience what was outside of Washington. When presented with the option to join my mother in Tacoma, I couldn't hold back the excitement. I didn't want to stay in the trailer park where my dad lived, in a tiny mobile home doing skateboard tricks with other kids in the area. I had a curiosity about the new area, a desire to see and explore something more. That desire is what really pulled me out of Burlington and set me about on the course I took.

But now that I've been to so many places -- Utah, Venezuela, Japan, New York, Egypt, Florida, and California -- I'm ready to settle down. My wife and I are making plans to be here, in this house, for the rest of our lives. Is this a temporary feeling, which might change in 5 years when we grow restless and hungry to experience more of the world? Or have we reached a point where we've seen enough to know that we're in a good place now? I'm not sure. Moving requires so many changes. It changes you as much as anything.

At some point, I will get the courage to reach out to my old childhood friend. A "hello there" after 30 years of silence. I want to know and understand his life trajectory, and what decisions and paths he took. Maybe this will help me understand that not all journeys are physical, that one can explore worlds within the same backyard, and find wonder in seemingly small changes and observations.
