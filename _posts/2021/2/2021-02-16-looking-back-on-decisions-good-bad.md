## Good decisions

1. **Getting embedded with product/engineering teams.** Whenever I embed with engineering teams, life goes well as a tech writer. When I'm distanced from teams, things take a turn for the worse.

2. **Using an intake process that required a lot of info up front information.** Intake processes that put some information pain on the requester make it easier as a tech writer because you have more of the information you want. (See my process for [large intake requests](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_doc_projects.html) versus [small intake requests](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_small_doc_requests.html).)

3. **Sharing out updates to wider group.** Broadcasting all the good doc updates made during the past month or so did an amazing job at increasing the visiblity of our team.

4. **Slack channel groups as a means of communication about docs.** When the company adopted Slack and we started using channels for doc projects, it was a game changer. Communication was so much easier, as people could easily tag others into the conversation.

5. **Aligning doc efforts with the orgâ€™s strategic priorities.** There's a lot one could focus on, but when we wised up and started aligning our doc priorities with the group's strategic priorities, that is, putting more focus on the projects that mattered, our work took on more importance and recognition.

6. **Aligning and focusing on dev rel groups to drive our focus.** In addition to aligning strategically with the important projects in the org, aligning with the dev rel group (aka solutions architects, partner engineers) helped us focus efforts in the right direction.

7. **Using workflow maps for complex processes.** For lengthy processes, I used workflow maps and received great feedback through this. I'm convinced that it's the way to go when creating lengthy implementation processes. I wrote about this here: [Principle 1: Let users switch between macro and micro views](/simplifying-complexity/macro-micro.html).

8. **Embedding feedback forms directly below docs.** We experimented with a few different ways of collecting feedback, but when we put a form embedded right below topics as an iframe, making it dead simple to communicate feedback, we started receiving a ton of it. I wrote about this here: [Processes for collecting feedback post-release](/learnapidoc/docapis_collecting_feedback_post_release.html).

9. **Using an engineering workflow for doc work.** When we adopted the same workflow for docs that engineers used in their teams (Scrum), engineers more readily understood the doc workflow and how we managed the work. It was also easier to plug into engineering workflows.

10. **Setting a timer for 4 hrs each day to write.** When I started a four-hour timer to make sure I spent a good part of the day actually writing content, my productivity went way up. I wrote about this here: [Writing productivity tip: Focus sessions](/blog/writing-productivity-through-focus-sessions/).

11. **Implementing Jekyll in a docs-as-code workflow.** I was fortunate to arrive at a time when we were eager to transition tools, and we implemented Jekyll. I got to work on the theme, the workflows, and other aspects of the solution. This was one of my major highlights, and I realized that I'm pretty good with tools. Looking back, this was the right solution, and really allowed us to deliver content in good ways.

## Minor mistakes

1. **Getting loaned out to another group while still reporting in the same group**. This was the dumbest mistake I ever made. If you're in one group but get loaned out to another group, you basically end up creating docs for both groups. Instead of getting loaned out, you might as well transition teams in a more formal way because it makes no sense to do work for a group you don't report into.

2. **Allowing contributors to commit without reviewing what they commit**. We had an idea of scaling docs by allowing engineering teams to write and contribute docs in an autonomous way. I didn't start closely examining some of these contributions until too late, and then I started to realize that we should have been more closely gatekeeping and reviewing the content.

3. **Not aligning more closely with support groups**. We ended up aligning with our dev rel teams to figure out what docs were the priority. The support team often interfaced with lower priority users. Their processes largely remained separate in a way that we never fixed. There was always a chasm between docs and support, even when we merged under the same umbrella.

4. **Not measuring progress in a quantifiable way**. I tried a lot of different ways to track metrics, as I had 5 managers in 5 years and this topic (what to track and report on) always surfaced. No metrics ever really stuck. We shifted from tracking one thing to the next in ways that never seemed to catch the attention of leadership.

5. **Not implementing more scripts to check doc health in automated ways**. I spent a lot of time on tools, perhaps too much time. I developed extensive scripts to identify outdated content, but I never saw this approach to the end. As a result, a lot of docs gradually went out of date without signaling any alarm bells.

That's about it. I enjoyed my time at Amazon, just like I've enjoyed my time at every company I've worked at. Each company offers unique experiences, culture, people, tools, and challenges. What works well at one company might not work at another, but I hope to repeat what worked well and reduce the mistakes as I move forward.
