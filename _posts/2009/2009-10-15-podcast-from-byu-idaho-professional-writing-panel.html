<p>Last week I was up at BYU Idaho at a writing conference for students looking to enter professional writing. This is a recording of a panel I participated on with two other writers, Scott Cameron and Keith Harten. The three of us (two technical writers and one editor) answer questions from students for about an hour. For students looking to go into technical writing, editing, or other professional writing careers, this podcast may answer a lot of questions.</p>
