<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Disaster-Preparedness/dp/1592578934" target="_blank"><em>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Disaster Preparedness</em></a> is John Hedtke's latest book—the 26<sup>th</sup> book he's written. In it, Hedtke explains that although most people think disasters are only major catastrophes, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or floods, actually a disaster occurs whenever your needs exceed your resources and your ability to respond, and the normal processes of your life are disrupted. In this interview, I also ask John about book publishing—what his writing routine is, what advice he has for writers, and what keeps him motivated.</p>
