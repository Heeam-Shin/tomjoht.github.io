<p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/08/24/review-of-conversation-and-community-the-social-web-for-documentation-by-anne-gentle/">my review</a> of Anne Gentle's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conversation-Community-Social-Web-Documentation/dp/1937434109">Conversation and Community: The Social Web for Documentation</a>, I also interviewed her for a podcast. Now you can listen to Anne talk about some of the concepts in her book in a more personal way through the headphones of your iPod. In this 40 minute podcast, we cover questions such as the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>What's the first step in connecting with your users?</li>
<li>Why are wikis used more internally than externally?</li>
<li>How can you build trust with users?</li>
<li>What's the 90-9-1 percent rule and how can you change the 1 percent part?</li>
<li>What three steps can you follow for any strategy with social media?</li>
<li>What is "read wear" and how can you make that content more visible?</li>
<li>What happens when you break the listen-participate-share-then-lead model?</li>
<li>How can you use Twitter into your documentation strategy?</li>
<li>What mindset is antithetical to building conversations and communities with your users?</li>
</ul>
