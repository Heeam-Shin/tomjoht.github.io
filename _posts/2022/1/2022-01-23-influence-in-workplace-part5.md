I concluded that the thinking/writing process is probably more valuable than the subject, but also that the subject should be something you're drawn to because you'll be most productive being in that space. In this section, I'll get a little more down-to-earth about my audience and focus."

### Audience and focus

On the web, for this blog, my audience consists of other technical writers. In the workplace, I'm not interested in interacting with other writers across the org (they can already read my blog if they want) as much as I want to interact with people within my organizational unit. And the people within my organizational unit consists of product owners, developer relations, support, engineers, project leads, tech leads, quality assurance, senior executives, instructional designers, other technical writers, and more. At least, this is the audience I want to engage with, rather than other tech writers beyond my group at work.

The diversity of audience is a huge difference. As a tech writer, I can share an experience related to writing docs, or a doc-related tool, etc., and other tech writers can often relate to the experience. We build on this common ground.

Take away that common ground, and you have to substitute in another way to bring people together. What brings all of these diverse people together? Most likely, they're all working on the same product, focused within the same business domain.

Even if these diverse roles share a common product domain, their interests in that product will differ. A senior executive will have different interests than a quality engineer. A product manager will have different interests than an instructional designer, and so on. I guarantee you one thing: very few will have much interest in documentation itself. The nitty gritty details of documentation, such as how content is organized, styled, authored, published, etc., are going to be somewhat unimportant to these teams, in the same way that the database schema or code structure might not interest technical writers.

This makes it more challenging to connect with this diverse group. What content do you focus on? If you don't write meta content about the details of documentation, what then do you write about? Two topics might be appropriate:

* **User experiences and pain points.** For example, where are users getting stuck and why.
* **Tech news/trends within the business domain itself.** For example, what advancements and other new tech trends are occurring in this space.
* **Comparisons to competitors**. For example, how does our product and terminology differ from our competitors?

These topics seem worthwhile and might have broad interest despite the person's role. Of course, the focus on user experience and pain points is much more germane to documentation. Tech developments within the field itself might be outside the tech writer's expertise, but surveying industry trends and news isn't as hard as it seems. The analysis with competitor offerings likewise might be beyond the tech writer's knowledge.

### User experiences and pain points

Writing about user experience and pain points focuses tech writers in the right direction, for sure, but this focus is not as much a natural fit as it sounds. User experience and pain points relate to the existing product features, not to features in development. Tech writers usually focus most of their time and energy documenting upcoming features for releases, so they're a bit removed from the current user experience.

Additionally, engineers tend to focus on features for upcoming releases as well, so their attention isn't always on the current user experience. Granted, pain points in the current experience should drive the product roadmap, but often the only teams focused on the current user experience are support groups and developer relations.

For example, I often see a huge incoming flow of bugs filed by partners. Sometimes when I look at these tickets, I think about ways better docs and more complete information might have prevented the ticket in the first place. But it's hard to find the discipline to look through these bugs and write docs related to the issues (which are all over the map).

Instead, it's much more natural to focus on documentation for an upcoming feature or release. Releases are often blocked without accompanying documentation, but existing bugs can remain in backlogs and even be resolved without any additions to the docs. (And the tech writer's attention is dictated by priority.)

If tech writers are focused on what's coming rather than the current user experience, this makes it difficult to focus on user pain points. However, pushing tech writers to focus more on the current experience would be beneficial, so it might be a good focus anyway. The tech writer's interpretation of user pain points will inevitably connect to documentation needs or efforts.

### Tech news/trends within the business domain itself

Another focus could be within the business domain itself. What trends, new products, and other newsworthy items are happening related to the product domain? For example, you could summarize reports from Gartner, Forrester, and other insight sources. You could describe relevant survey outcomes, or trending topics on various platforms. You don't have to be a pundit who assesses whether trends are here to stay or go; instead, you could just relay the information that you glean from other sources.

### Comparisons to competitors

When I worked at Amazon, I once wrote a detailed competitive analysis between Fire TV and Roku, describing the entirety of the developer's app-development journey from beginning to end (how they create an app, how terms differ, and so on). The report was interesting to senior leaders, and it was also informative to doc efforts as well.

As a writer, it helped me realize how terminology differed, what the strengths of our product were (as well as the gaps), how developers had to split their code bases for apps across streaming media platforms, and more. That's why tech news and trends also relates to documentation and might still be relevant and informative.

A focus on competitor offerings, techniques, and content and how it might compare with one's own company could be interesting, especially because so many people tend to be focused solely within their own company's products. I'm not sure if a competitive analysis could be an ongoing focus, and there might be a lot of landmines here, but it's certainly a focus that gets people's attention.

### Bringing up docs where relevant

With all of these topics, doc topics will naturally surface. For example, in analyzing a competitor's offering, you might highlight the related documentation, or address your company's own documentation. Same with user pain points. Trends might relate to upcoming features on your roadmap. This tie-in with documentation will help reinforce some of the reasons for the site itself.

### What about natural tendencies toward topics of personal interest?



### Space to write and publish

Another difference in the workplace is lack of an appropriate space to write and publish. On the web, blogs are part of the fabric of the internet. You can simply start up a website focused on any topic, begin publishing content, and it would be a totally natural motion.

Not so in the workplace. In the workplace, blogs are rare. If you do find an internal blog in the workplace, chances are it will consist of such trivial content (pics of their dog at work wearing a hat, for example) that no one takes the medium seriously.

Where, then, do you publish, and how do you brand the content? More acceptable content forms in the workplace are reports, newsletters, and meeting notes, often pushed out to email lists.

However, not having a website is a real disadvantage. In the workplace, if you put all your content in the email itself, it's hard to track reads. Newsletter tools can often indicate how many people opened the email, but that's about it. You won't know if they spent two seconds or two minutes looking at it, or what caught their attention.

On the web, with newsletters, it's common to provide short summaries in the email followed by *Read more* links (with link trackers to gauge interest). When readers click to read more, the article opens up in a web page that has more analytics tracking mechanisms to visits, time on page, and more. To follow this same pattern in the workplace, you need an internal website for content. Almost every company makes it easy to create an internal website, since this infrastructure is essential for teams to share information about their team.

But what if the website wasn't another team site? What if instead the site had a product domain focus? Will readers come to a documentation team site when their role has little to do with documentation? Probably not. But a site focused on tech trends and user pain points related to the product they're working with? That's much more likely. The infusion of documentation into the conversation would be a subtle way of bringing to surface the importance and relevance of docs.

The website serves another purpose: discoverability. If you rely only email-driven content, how will people find your content after the initial email push? Many people search internally for terms, and if your content exists online, you will attract these people to it. In contrast, if your content lives only in email, its lifespan will be incredibly short (less than a day). You end up shortchanging the time spent for the returns.

## Building an audience

On the web, a key element of a website is to capture reader emails. The newsletter lets you push content to them, which seems old-school but turns out to be a powerful way to reach readers. On the internal website at a company, building an audience is a bit different. You have a license to automatically push content out to specific groups, without asking for their permission. These email groups are set up to capture topics of interest, so you aren't breaking the rules this way.

But how do you balance goals of reaching additional employees who are outside of these lists? And what if people sign up to your newsletter who are already on the lists?

One way would be to identify the main groups related to the content, and list them below the newsletter signup. That way you could indicate that if a member is part of X,Y, or Z group, they are automatically included in the distribution. If not, they can sign up. (Though they can't unsubscribe unless they leave the groups.)

After you add several articles to your site, you send out a newsletter with links to each article. The newsletter links should have link trackers to see which topics are most popular, and other analytics should be in place to measure site engagement.





what are you trying to do? who are you trying to reach? why not set up 1:1's with those people?

the case for the develpioer portal and need for what's going on

what unites them? the user? pain points?

emerging tech as a common uniter?

what if you were to send a weekly update. not meeting notes, but a weekly update the summarizes the biggest issues of the week? might be more efficient.
