## Building an audience

Relentless content production alone is only part of the game to online engagement. Most writers want to have readers. There's a common belief that the internet is so vast and wide, it doesn't matter what you write about &mdash; the right audience will eventually find you and you'll build a community around your common interests.

Well, sometimes it's hard for the right audience to locate the right content creator. The audience doesn't magically materialize when you publish a post. You have to help this audience find you, and finding you requires the content creator to do at least several things: build an engaging website, share your content on social media, infuse your content with SEO.

* **Build an engaging website**. You need to be familiar with the web's tools for online content creation, whether blogs, videos, podcasts (including feeds), newsletter tools, and more. Using tools like WordPress isn't hard, but there are many aspects to managing a website that require web savvy. If you have a static site generator, you might need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the kind of user experience you want. Others might use subsites within existing platforms, but that still requires customization and branding. Having an engaging site that communicates your content's focus and makes it easy for users to subscribe (whether to RSS, a podcast feed, a newsletter, follow button, or other) is key to growing an audience and establishing an online presence.

* **Share content on social media**. You need to broadcast your content in the right channels. Sharing your content on Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, Slack, and other social circles (if appropriate) help builds visibility for the content. It's somewhat uncomfortable to broadcast new posts on these social channels (and sometimes it's uncouth to do so, especially if it comes across as a one-way megaphone), but the online influencer needs to be unabashed about sharing their content. I only share links to posts on Twitter and Linkedin (and video files on YouTube), but others use the social forums that are appropriate for the type of content they create.

* **Infuse content with SEO**. SEO also plays another role, often underplayed, in helping the audience find your content. Ninety percent of the traffic on my site comes from organic SEO from Google. To lace your content with the right keywords, you need to understand the basics of SEO, which is sometimes treated as a dark-arts practice that feels unnatural for anyone whose content creation motives are pure. But when I look at my site analytics, it appears that most users are first-time visitors, brought to my site by their searches on Google.

Even with social media sharing and SEO, many posts, videos, or podcasts probably never reach the audience who would actually like to consume the content. It takes time for the right content creators and audience to find each other. Literally, it can take years to build up your audience. In the meantime, if each new post seems to get zero comments, or no clicks or reads, etc., content creators might struggle to feel that their efforts are worth it. This is one reason why content creators need to find value in the activity itself, independent of any readers or influence.

## Initial attempts at workplace content

In my initial attempt to create content in the workplace, I focused on creating documentation reports and sharing meeting notes. I started creating documentation reports because a senior leader wanted them, and I was more than willing to assemble and share them. Then later, a space opened up where a variety of groups could share meeting notes (with the purpose of helping keep everyone informed), so I started sharing meeting notes as well. I wrote about these two formats here:

* [Sending doc status reports -- a tool for visibility and relationship building](/learnapidoc/docapis_status_reports.html)
* [Broadcasting your meeting notes to influence a wider audience](/learnapidoc/docapis_meeting_notes.html#what-if-sensitive-topics-are-discussed-during-the-meeting)

However, as I was just sending this content over email, it was hard to track opens and reads. Occasionally someone replied "Thanks" or "Great report" or similar. But after a colleague told me that the meeting notes might not be getting the readership I want, I needed to do a test. Instead of putting all the content into the email, I instead listed bullet points of the topics discussed, followed by a link to the meeting notes in a Google Doc.

It turns out my colleague was right -- only about 3 people actually clicked the link. This made me rethink the type of content that others might find engaging. I realized that meeting notes were probably a low-value form of content, and probably not worth the effort of the more detailed writeup and summarizing of issues that I'd been doing.

I also started to rethink the readership of the documentation reports as well. These reports were getting long, and I hadn't been getting much feedback on them. What if the reads were equally abysmal, just like meeting notes? My colleague explained that email might not be the best format for this content, as many people's inboxes were just streams of unread email from the dozens of lists they follow. My email was likely not having the reach, but I suspected it was more than just the format. It was the content focus itself -- documentation wasn't really interesting to others, it seemed. I decided I needed to return to the drawing board to rethink my approach.
