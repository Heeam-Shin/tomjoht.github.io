## Building an audience

Relentless content production alone is only part of the game to online engagement. Most writers want to have readers. There's a common belief that the internet is so vast and wide, it doesn't matter what you write about &mdash; the right audience will eventually find you and you'll build a community around your common interests.

Well, sometimes it's hard for the right audience to locate the right content creator. The audience doesn't magically materialize when you publish a post. You have to help this audience find you, and finding you requires the content creator to follow several best practices: build an engaging website, share your content on social media, infuse your content with SEO.

* **Build an engaging website**. You need to be familiar with the web's tools for online content creation, whether blogs, videos, podcasts (including feeds), newsletter tools, and more. Using tools like WordPress isn't hard, but there are many aspects to managing a website that require web savvy. If you have a static site generator, you might need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the kind of user experience you want. Others might use subsites within existing platforms, but that still requires customization and branding. Having an engaging site that communicates your content's focus and makes it easy for users to subscribe (whether to RSS, a podcast feed, a newsletter, follow button, or other) is key to growing an audience and establishing an online presence.

* **Share content on social media**. You need to broadcast your content in the right channels. Sharing your content on Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, Slack, and other social circles (if appropriate) help builds visibility for the content. It's somewhat uncomfortable to broadcast new posts on these social channels (and sometimes it's uncouth to do so, especially if it comes across as a one-way megaphone), but the online influencer needs to be unabashed about sharing their content. I only share links to posts on Twitter and Linkedin (and video files on YouTube), but others use the social forums that are appropriate for the type of content they create.

* **Infuse content with SEO**. SEO also plays another role, often underplayed, in helping the audience find your content. Ninety percent of the traffic on my site comes from organic SEO from Google. To infuse your content with the right keywords, you need to understand the basics of SEO, which is sometimes treated as a dark-arts practice that feels unnatural for anyone whose content creation motives are pure. But when I look at my site analytics, it appears that most users are first-time visitors, brought to my site by their searches on Google. You should be aware of keywords and phrases that people search for that land then on your site, and other analytics around trending topics.

* **Capture your audience with a newsletter**. Another

Even with social media sharing and SEO, many posts, videos, or podcasts probably never reach the audience who would actually like to consume the content. It takes time for the right content creators and audience to find each other. Literally, it can take years to build up your audience. In the meantime, if each new post seems to get zero comments, or no clicks or reads, etc., content creators might struggle to feel that their efforts are worth it. This is one reason why content creators need to find value in the activity itself, independent of any readers or influence.
