## Building an audience

One of the first steps toward running a successful site online is to build an audience. There's a common belief that the internet is so vast and wide, it doesn't matter what you write about &mdash; the right audience will eventually find you and you'll build a community around your common interests.

Well, sometimes it's hard for the right audience to locate the right content creator. The audience doesn't magically materialize when you publish a post. You have to help this audience find you, and that connection requires content creators to follow several best practices: build an engaging website, share your content on social media, infuse your content with SEO, capture subscribers, and analyze your analytics. These principles sound basic, and they are, but they are the fundamental way that influence on the web works. Let's look at each of these principles.

### Principle 1: Build an engaging website

The first step is usually to build a website. You need a home for your content -- a place for search engines to bring visitors. To build a site, you need to be familiar with the web's tools for online content creation, whether blogs, videos, podcasts (including feeds), newsletter tools, and more. Using tools like WordPress isn't hard, but there are many aspects to managing a website that require web savvy. If you have a static site generator, you might need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the kind of user experience you want.

Others might use subsites within existing platforms (for example, YouTube channels or Instagram accounts), but that still requires customization and branding. Having an engaging space that communicates your content's focus and makes it easy for users to subscribe (whether to RSS, a podcast feed, a newsletter, follow button, or other) is key to growing an audience and establishing an online presence. If you don't have a website, it becomes much more difficult to establish a presence online.

### Principle 2: Share content on social media

Another step toward visibility is to broadcast your content in the right channels. Sharing your content on Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, Slack, and other social circles (if appropriate) help builds awareness for the content.

It's somewhat uncomfortable to broadcast new posts on these social channels (and sometimes it's inappropriate to do so, especially if it comes across as a one-way megaphone), but the online influencer needs to be unabashed about sharing their content. I share links to posts on only Twitter and Linkedin (and videos on YouTube), as well as podcasts on iTunes and other channels. I should probably share my content across more channels, but doing so feels a bit spammy. At any rate, use the social forums that are appropriate for the type of content you create, and don't be afraid to share your content with others.

### Principle 3: Infuse content with SEO

SEO also plays another role, often underplayed, in helping the audience find your content. Ninety percent of the traffic on my site comes from organic SEO from Google. To infuse your content with the right keywords, you need to understand the basics of SEO, which is sometimes treated as a dark-arts practice but is likely the most powerful way to attract people to your site.

When I look at my [site analytics](/blog/2021-site-analytics-reflections), it appears that most users are first-time visitors, brought to my site by their searches on Google. When you create content online, you should be aware of keywords and phrases that people search for related to your site, build landing pages around those keywords, and leverage other trends you observe from analytics. (I admit I often ignore keywords, but I do look at analytics in depth at least yearly.) Paying attention to analytics can also help guide your content creation efforts.

### Principle 4: Capture subscriber emails or signups

Another important practice is to capture subscribers through newsletter signups or other subscriptions. It sounds marketingesque, and it is, but it also works. Andy Budd sarcastically described the web in 2022 on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A typical website visit in 2022<br><br>1. Figure out how to decline all but essential cookies<br>2. Close the support widget asking if I need help<br>3. Stop the auto-playing video<br>4. Close the “subscribe to our newsletter” pop-up<br>5. Try and remember why I came here in the first place</p>&mdash; Andy Budd (@andybudd) <a href="https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1477634654429663237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Among other site prompts, it can be annoying to be bombarded with prompts to subscribe to a newsletter. On my site, I don't auto-launch a popup for this -- though I probably should, because these newsletter signup popups work.

I made a major mistake blogging for the first 10 years. I thought RSS was the way people would read blogs, and it initially was. Then Google Reader shut down, and RSS never fully recovered as a means of reading content. One way to capture the first-time visitors on your site is usually through some newsletter signup. Then later you can push content to them. (If you're publishing on another platform, like YouTube, you probably want people to follow/subscribe instead. The principle is the same.)

When I share links to new posts on social media, I typically get about 25 clicks from sharing the links on Twitter and Linkedin. But when I send out a newsletter to 6,000+ technical writers with the links, I see 10x the number of clicks. By tracking links, I've quickly realized that newsletters are a powerful way to reach an audience and bring them back to you site.

### Principle 5: Track your analytics

One final tip for successful online engagement is to look at your analytics. When you send out links to new content, include link trackers to see how many people are clicking. I use [Rebrandly](https://rebrandly.com/), but you could use many other services (for example, Bitly) that will give you feedback about who is clicking the links to the content. It's easy to see what topics are interesting to people based on these clicks.

Additionally, your site should have analytics tracking, such as Google Analytics, to give you more details about popular pages on your site, incoming landing pages, demographics, and more. Analytics gives you unspoken feedback about your content. You can see how popular content is by merely looking at how many people clicked a link or visited a page.

Without that feedback, you're often writing in the dark. The feedback doesn't mean you should pursue topics that are more popular, because sometimes you achieve high hits from random topics (like this [grasshopper post](/2007/07/31/grasshoppers-that-look-like-aliens/), which at one time was my most popular post, but I certainly wasn't going to write more about grasshoppers).

## Have patience, but also iterate

Even by following these basic best practices, many posts, videos, or podcasts probably never reach the audience who would actually like to consume the content. It takes time for the right content creators and audience to find each other. Literally, it can take years to build up your audience. In the meantime, if each new post seems to get zero comments, or no clicks or reads, etc., content creators might struggle to feel that their efforts are worth it. This is one reason why content creators need to find value in the activity itself, independent of any readers or influence. You should recognize early on that influence on the web isn't an overnight phenomenon (at least not in my experience). It's going to take awhile.

I resolved to pivot my approach, to rearchitect the information using all the web techniques I described in the previous post. There was just one thing I couldn't quite figure out: the content. If people fundamentally weren't interested in documentation topics, much less meta documentation, and this was my only knowledge and experience, then how could I ever create content that would have any reach, even in the right format?
