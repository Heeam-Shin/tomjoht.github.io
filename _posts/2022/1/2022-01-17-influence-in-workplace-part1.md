## Introduction

In recent post, I mentioned a topic I'm developing for an upcoming presentation: [How to increase awareness of tech comm inside corporate walls](/blog/megacomm-presentation-increase-awareness-of-tech-comm), with this description:

> **How to increase awareness of tech comm inside corporate walls**
>
> I've been a blogger writing about tech comm for 15+ years, and in that time have increased awareness and education of tech comm to thousands of tech writers globally. However, creating the same awareness about tech comm inside corporate walls has been a different challenge that has frequently eluded me. Like many tech writers, I've often felt somewhat invisible to the engineering and product teams, business executives, and other stakeholders around me. It's easy to feel left out of the loop, to interact with people who have little idea about tech writer processes for authoring and publishing, who don't understand what we do, where we publish, or who we even are.

> Recently, I've begun to discover some blogging-like strategies that actually work within the corporate context. Not by creating an internal blog and spamming everyone in the company, nor by trolling corporate interest groups with linkbait. Instead, there are some simple strategies for boosting awareness of tech comm within the corporate context. The strategies require some writing effort and can put you out of your comfort zone, but the formula essentially follows the same strategy for awareness on the web, which is to create relevant content and share it with those around you on a regular basis. Following this formula, others in your company will be aware of doc resources, what you're publishing, upcoming features, how your group works, your doc challenges, strategies, and more. If you follow these strategies, your group and documentation will be much more visible to those around you.

In this series, "A hypothesis about influence on the web and the workplace," I want to lay out my hypothesis a bit more and explain the approach. Many of my ideas are in flight, so don't expect everything to be tried and tested here over a long period of time. This is something I'm experimenting with, and there are clear challenges in applying the same practices on the web to the workplace. I invite you to share insights with me, either in comments or through my [contact form](/contactme).

## Influencers on the web

On the web, many people who don't have any special expertise or prominent office/position can nonetheless exert a lot of visibility and influence. These people are often referred to as "social media influencers" or "micro-influencers" (to describe smaller, more niche audiences). Ki and Kim explain:

> SMIs [social media influencers] are people who have established credibility with large social media audiences because of their knowledge and expertize on particular topics, and thereby exert a significant influence on their followers’ and peer consumers’ decisions. SMIs also can be defined as independent third‐party endorsers who have developed sizeable social networks by sharing details about their personal lives, experiences, and opinions publicly through texts, pictures, videos, hashtags, location check‐ins, etc. ("The mechanism by which social media influencers persuade consumers: The role of consumers’ desire to mimic.")

Many different platforms and channels on the web can have their own influencers. Content can be in the form of written blogs, image posts, videos, or other type of content. The key idea is that the influencer is uncredentialed and perhaps untrained -- their rise is influencer is solely through the content they create and share online.

The influence is in part due to the "Megaphone Effect" of the web, which allows seeming nobodies to amplify their voice and reach. McQuarrie et all explain:

> The megaphone effect ... occurs when ordinary consumers, defined as individuals lacking professional experience and not holding an institutional or family position, post to the web about consumption and acquire a mass audience for these posts. ... Consumer bloggers achieve an audience that historically was only available to institutionally located professionals (McCracken 1986), but they achieve this audience by means of publicly consuming: choosing, evaluating, and engaging with clothing (in our focal example) and posting accounts of this consumption that garner a large audience of strangers. ("The megaphone effect: Taste and audience in fashion blogging.")

In other words, influencers acquire their audience not by virtue of some professional position or title. They acquire it through their own consumption of something (in this case, clothing, because the author focuses on fashion influencers).

Visibility and influence on the web aren't that difficult to achieve. The basic formula is to choose a topic, produce a lot of content about it, and share it with the right community. Keep this up for years, and if you do, and if the audience connects with your content, you can become visible, recognized, and somewhat influential in the space.

Choosing a focus and posting constantly about it establishes your expertise -- not courses, certifications, and degrees. By focusing on a specific subject, you help build a sense of knowledge, awareness, and personal expertise toward it. A prominent early blogger, Robert Scoble, tells those who are unemployed to focus on what they want to and then create content about it:

> Post something that teaches me something about what you want to do every day. If you want to drive a cab, you better go out and take pictures of cabs. Think about cabs. Put suggestions for cabbies up. Interview cabbies. You better have a blog that is nothing but cabs. Cabs. Cabs. Cabs all the time. ("If you are laid off, here’s how to socially network")

In this way, individuals can create their own professional destinies on the web. If you want to be perceived as a cabbie expert, you post frequently about cabs. Because I've written extensively about API documentation, I've established a certain brand and expertise online about "Tom Johnson and API documentation." It's not hard for people to make that connection. The phenomenon of the web is that someone can build their expertise by merely writing and posting content about it. Many people are much more experienced in writing and developing API documentation than me, but I've created a connection and perception online that makes me more influential with the topic than those who do not have that same online presence.

There are some nuances here, such as why some content creators are more influential than others. I imagine that a blog on cabs all the time could get pretty boring if they're just random pics of cabs. Not everyone who churns out content amasses an audience. The content has to be interesting, engaging, and worth reading. That's the tough part.

In my view, the formula for engaging content is the same as it's always been: story. If you can tell a story, you can engage readers. Many times the conflict for that story comes from your personal experiences and struggles that give context and meaning to facts and events. The need to inject story is why transparency, honesty, and personal experiences tend to dominate blog posts -- it's hard to engage readers otherwise.

But stories don't have to be personal. Stories can also be the way you wrestle with conflicting ideas, and how others wrestle with them. A good writer, like a journalist, can zero in on non-personal challenges and weave in a larger context. When I studied literary nonfiction in college, I realized that the most engaging nonfiction content combines personal experience with larger, non-personal ideas in interlocking ways.

## Motivation to create content

In addition to creating engaging content, influencers must be relentless in creating new content. Blogs need at least one or more posts per week to keep the audience's attention. The web requires an insatiable amount of content to keep one's attention.

With the proliferation of smartphones, people are reading and consuming content more than ever. The next time you're waiting somewhere (on a train, in a line, at a cafe), lift your head up to see what everyone else is doing while waiting -- chances are, they're staring at their phones, consuming content. Influencers have to produce content in a continual way to keep the audience's attention.

Because of the need to constantly create content, often with little tangible reward, influencers need to be driven by more than calculated motives for influence. What drives someone to write a new blog post, week after week, year after year, without experiencing creative burnout? To be sustainable in the long run, influencers must find enjoyment in the content creation activity itself, without many external rewards.

For me, I write because I value writing as a tool for thinking. As long as I'm mentally awake, I'll continue to write to organize and refine my thoughts on subjects. The value and utility of writing is one reason I became a professional technical writer. Any influence from that writing is happenstance, a byproduct of writing and publishing. I can't imagine someone sustaining a long-term campaign, undertaken for years at great personal expense with little financial incentive, with the goal of *influencing an audience* toward a specific end (unless you're a megalomaniac).

I started my blog in 2006. I didn't start out with the goal of influencing my audience toward some end. I just liked writing and interacting in the online community, reflecting on my experiences as a technical writer, pursuing lines of thought, questioning best practices, exploring new tools, sorting out my thoughts (like I'm doing right now), etc. In short, using writing as a tool for thinking. Any influence that results isn't intentional.

Blogging is not like a chapter in Aristotle's *Rhetoric*, which tries to explain what tactics to use to win over your audience for any argument. Sustained activity online is like floating in a river &mdash; you're much less aware of the direction you're heading. You just end up in a new area based on the pull of the tides and how you like to swim. A certain subject grabs your interest, you write about it, and share it.

What happens when you share content online, though, is kind of magical. People read and connect with you, and sometimes you hit on themes that resonate with others, and their feedback also resonates with you. Something positive comes out of the exchange, usually. Maybe it's an insight that helps someone, or maybe that insight comes to you personally through the act of writing. A good post is one that changes the way you, the writer, sees the world.

It's not all warm fuzzies, though. Many times, people might call you out on misguided ideas or information gaps you're not seeing. Critical feedback is also valuable, as it helps with course correction. I benefit from the wisdom of thousands of technical writers out there, many of whom are more knowledgeable and experienced than me and who can help me avoid career pitfalls or mistakes. Mostly, though, I often receive encouragement and notes from people saying that certain themes resonated true for them or that my resources were helpful to them. I love that. (For example, read through the comments on my [Coffee dashboard](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/learnapidoc).)

It's that sense of connection, information sharing, two-way insights, and other positivity that I want to bring into the workplace. There's no reason why that experience should be limited to web only. But how can it be done? Can you bring the same phenomenon of social media influencers from the web to the workplace?

Before diving into what might work in the workplace, let's look at a few aspects related to content production on the web.
