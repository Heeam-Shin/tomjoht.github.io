Despite the failure of these doc reports and meeting notes formats, I hardly fault myself. I was simply following the same conventions that nearly any group does inside the corporation -- stuffing all updates into a long email and blasting it out. Different spaces have different communication mediums, and inside the corporation, this was the expected form and delivery.

Part of the reason I didn't incorporate any blog techniques is because blogs inside corporations are practically nonexistent. But there is a format that is common, and it's highly similar to blogs: newsletters. Just as blogs comprise much of the fabric of the web, newsletters are the staple of corporate communications.

Newsletter content contains a variety of info, from light and personal information such as employee spotlights, org announcements, and informational tidbits to more substantial information, product deep dives, strategic directions, tech tips, and explanations of initiatives to keep employees informed about what's going on at a company.

Sending newsletters is a practice companies have followed not only in the last century, but apparently for the last 2,000 years. In *An analysis of the corporate newsletter as a form of internal and external communication*, Cole traces the first newsletter ("news and letters") back to ancient China, specifically to the "Han Dynasty in 200 b.c. for fast communication between cities."

Cole's analysis is actually a 200-page master's thesis on newsletters, which she published in 1993 (before the widespread emergence of the internet). I had no idea that newsletters had such a rich and dominant history in corporations. Cole analyzes both external newsletters and internal newsletters.

## External newsletters

An external newsletter's purpose is usually to raise awareness and interest in the company's products and services. Cole says "a newsletter is effective if it can attract the reader's eye towards certain advertised products or services." The newsletter often "wins clients because the newsletters portrays its company as a leader in the field with a good reputation." Even though the focus is on building relationships with customers, any org that sends out a newsletter might have similar goals of increasing the appeal of the org's products and services.

The approach in external newsletters isn't entirely marketing collateral, though. Long before "content marketing strategies" became popular, companies that sent out newsletters realized that they needed to provide valuable content to customers, not just marketing collateral. Cole writes:

> A frequent, cynical response when someone receives an external newsletter in the mail is most likely, "Oh, they're just trying to sell me something." Knowing the consumer's aversion to the "hard sell," most external newsletter editors hire design agencies which disguise the marketing content with pictures, distracting designs and "objective" writing. Their desire is to draw in the skimmer, invite him to read on. The key to pulling the skimmer into reading the copy is in convincing him that the content of the newsletter is full of information that is relevant and helpful to him. Anne Murphy advises this in the Inc. article "The Best Newsletters in America": "To get read, a newsletter must add value by informing the reader. . . The moral: Let the sales literature tout the products" (72).

In other words, avoid the overt messaging in sales literature, and instead look to provide value to the readers. Recognize that through the newsletter, you are promoting an image, a brand, communicating with the audience, and remaining visible. The strategy behind content marketing is similar: provide valuable content to the reader to build a relationship; don't just try to sell a product.

## Internal newsletters

Internal newsletters might not be promoting products and services, but they are promoting something nonetheless: the company to the employees. In research about the purpose of corporate newsletters, Cole highlights these top 5 reasons for newsletters in companies:

> * Improving morale and fostering goodwill between employees and
management.
> * Informing employees about internal changes;
> * Explaining compensation and benefit plans;
> * Changing employee behavior toward becoming more productive; and
> * Changing employee behavior toward becoming more quality
oriented (Troy 6).

Company leaders use newsletters as a tool for internal communication, making the newsletter not just a recent way of sharing news but also developing relationships with employees and others around them. The goal of newsletters is to make employees feel included, to build goodwill, to help them be more productive and informed.

Here's the part that surprises me, though. Whereas on the web, most newsletters consist of individual website articles that bring readers back to websites, in the corporation, newsletters almost always live in email inboxes. The emails contain all the content -- there aren't usually any links taking readers out to internal websites. As such, it's hard to track what employees are reading in these newsletters, and if you miss the newsletter, you simply miss the content.

You also can't search for the newsletter content on corporate search engines. If you arrived at the company after the newsletter was sent, you usually can't browse the newsletter archive. If there is an archive, it's likely a list of PDFs that look about as appealing to read as yesterday's news.

## Following common patterns

Despite the shortcomings of the newsletter format, I think it's important to leverage standard formats that are recognized as valid sources of information sharing in companies. Blogs aren't common within companies, but newsletters are. Is there really a difference? I'd argue that a good newsletter, one that communicates substantial information in candid ways, could move beyond the corporate limitations of email inbox delivery and intransigence and be hosted on an internal site, highly similar to a blog.

The problem with the word "blog" is that many people interpret blogs as casual diaries about the mundane aspects of lives no one cares about. In reality, the web is full of all kinds of sites, from the mundane self-focused blogs like I described to websites that seem more like online magazines or information centers than anything else.

### Space to write and publish

Another difference in the workplace is lack of an appropriate space to write and publish. On the web, blogs are part of the fabric of the internet. You can simply start up a website focused on any topic, begin publishing content, and it would be a totally natural motion.

Not so in the workplace. In the workplace, blogs are rare. If you do find an internal blog in the workplace, chances are it will consist of such trivial content (pics of their dog at work wearing a hat, for example) that no one takes the medium seriously.

Where, then, do you publish, and how do you brand the content? More acceptable content forms in the workplace are reports, newsletters, and meeting notes, often pushed out to email lists.

However, not having a website is a real disadvantage. In the workplace, if you put all your content in the email itself, it's hard to track reads. Newsletter tools can often indicate how many people opened the email, but that's about it. You won't know if they spent two seconds or two minutes looking at it, or what caught their attention.

On the web, with newsletters, it's common to provide short summaries in the email followed by *Read more* links (with link trackers to gauge interest). When readers click to read more, the article opens up in a web page that has more analytics tracking mechanisms to visits, time on page, and more. To follow this same pattern in the workplace, you need an internal website for content. Almost every company makes it easy to create an internal website, since this infrastructure is essential for teams to share information about their team.

But what if the website wasn't another team site? What if instead the site had a product domain focus? Will readers come to a documentation team site when their role has little to do with documentation? Probably not. But a site focused on tech trends and user pain points related to the product they're working with? That's much more likely. The infusion of documentation into the conversation would be a subtle way of bringing to surface the importance and relevance of docs.

The website serves another purpose: discoverability. If you rely only email-driven content, how will people find your content after the initial email push? Many people search internally for terms, and if your content exists online, you will attract these people to it. In contrast, if your content lives only in email, its lifespan will be incredibly short (less than a day). You end up shortchanging the time spent for the returns.

## Building an audience

On the web, a key element of a website is to capture reader emails. The newsletter lets you push content to them, which seems old-school but turns out to be a powerful way to reach readers. On the internal website at a company, building an audience is a bit different. You have a license to automatically push content out to specific groups, without asking for their permission. These email groups are set up to capture topics of interest, so you aren't breaking the rules this way.

But how do you balance goals of reaching additional employees who are outside of these lists? And what if people sign up to your newsletter who are already on the lists?

One way would be to identify the main groups related to the content, and list them below the newsletter signup. That way you could indicate that if a member is part of X,Y, or Z group, they are automatically included in the distribution. If not, they can sign up. (Though they can't unsubscribe unless they leave the groups.)

After you add several articles to your site, you send out a newsletter with links to each article. The newsletter links should have link trackers to see which topics are most popular, and other analytics should be in place to measure site engagement.





what are you trying to do? who are you trying to reach? why not set up 1:1's with those people?

the case for the develpioer portal and need for what's going on

what unites them? the user? pain points?

emerging tech as a common uniter?

what if you were to send a weekly update. not meeting notes, but a weekly update the summarizes the biggest issues of the week? might be more efficient.
