## Create engaging content

In the previous post, I explained how documentation reports and meeting notes failed to engage any readers. So let's talk about the key ingredient to influence: engaging content. What types of content will readers find engaging? This turns out to be a complex question.

The time-worn wisdom for content creation on the web is to create content you find engaging and let that audience who is also engaged by the same content naturally find you. Charles Lawrence pointed this out [on a recent Linkedin thread](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6884191526428250114?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6884191526428250114%2C6884200424472109056%29) from a post I shared. Charles says,

> In considering whether you should write more for yourself, rather than for your established audience, maybe consider yourself a member of a new audience that you have yet to discover as you expand into other subjects.
>
> In other words, in writing for yourself, you are also an audience member made up of like-minded people. You and your new audience just have to find each other.

For example, if you're really fascinated by bubblegum, write about it. Maybe only .01% of the people online will share your same fascination, but that's okay, you and the 300 people spread across remote parts of the globe will find you and you'll come together to build a thriving bubblegum community. The connectedness of the web allows niche communities to find each other, regardless of how geographically separated they are.

But suppose you don't want a niche audience -- you want lots of readers. And even though you're truly fascinated by bubblegum on a personal level, after extensive audience analysis, you find that your audience would be most interested in reading about puppies. But you hate puppies. Obviously, embracing a long-standing focus on puppy care, puppy training, and puppy walks isn't going to work long-term (except perhaps as a parody or puppy-hating blog, which might actually work temporarily before making your life miserable).

As I said previously, online content creators/influencers need to find enjoyment and interest in the activity itself, without any overt goals for influence. This is because the amount of energy and effort required versus the potential "payoff" will be tremendously imbalanced. You might spend 1,000 hours creating content that only a few people respond to. Can you sustain this kind of effort very long (writing about topics that bore you) without feeling more sense of reward? I doubt it.

## Echoes of similar patterns in the workplace

If these patterns are true on the web, would these patterns likewise be true in the workplace? What if my natural content direction isn't toward writing about a particular product domain? What if I more naturally connect with other tech writers in the workplace, even though these connections will have little impact on my role and docs within my group? Or what if my natural focus is even more niche, more irrelevant to any specific business application or knowledge, such as fascination with fonts, or file naming patterns?

There's a real risk that any efforts to influence or interact with a certain group of people -- by writing about topics you think they'll find relevant -- might backfire. You might discover that these topics don't interest them, don't interest you, and ultimately aren't worth spending time writing about. If you're working all day in documentation, the topics you naturally write about will be documentation-related, right? And if this group of people at work aren't interested in documentation, are you doomed to having only .01% of people at work read the email? Is that .01% worth it?

## Workplace culture and natural interests

There's real merit in focusing on what engages you. In "Google: a reflection of culture, leader, and management," S.K. Tran explains that high-performing companies like Google and Zappos place a high value on culture at work as the key to employee productivity and success. Tran writes:

> If an organization wants to hire talented people who cannot be recruited in cash, they must focus on building a great working culture. This includes working environment, meaningful work, and employeesâ€™ freedom (Meek 2015). Google is really touched by this philosophy, not just planning it out loud. They constantly experiment it, then improve it because it is paramount to the success of the company. For whichever company, all things start with people. A great company needs great people. One way to attract and retain such people is to make their work
interesting.

When I joined Google, I was surprised by how long it took to figure out what product area I would be documenting. It actually took about two months.

Contrast this culture with Amazon's. In [I took a job at Amazon, only to leave after 10 months.](https://benadam.me/thoughts/my-experience-at-amazon/), Ben Adam explains that as soon as he joined Amazon, he was met by a huge backlog of work and eager product managers asking when he would be able to deliver. Adam says,

> When I onboarded, there was a huge backlog of work that needed to be done with PMs and engineers asking for commitments on when I could deliver things by - urgent to not block progress, but also ironic that they are asking a person who has no clue what they are doing to deliver critical work.
>
> I realized over time that this was the norm. People come and go which has the net impact of making you feel like you are just a resource.

Adam explains that there's constant turnover at Amazon, which means the employees who remain are often shorthanded. Being shorthanded and overloaded then leads to more turnover, continuing the downward cycle.

When I onboarded at Amazon, there was a lot of emphasis on getting employees productive and contributing within one week or so. While I appreciated the immediate tasks, which helped put the work into focus and help me feel like I was contributing value, I did experience what Adam explains -- it seemed that we were always trying to backfill an open position. It would take months to find a qualified candidate, and by the time you trained them on the toolset and products (this took several months at least), another writer would leave, starting the cycle all over again.

In contrast, although I've seen turnover in my short time at Google, the writers moved to other internal teams, and there's a constant emphasis on ensuring that employees find meaning in the work and that teams are appropriately staffed. Many employees often engage in 20% projects where they can supplement their core work with hobby efforts they might be more passionate about. Keeping this sense of employee enthusiasm translates to higher productivity. Tran says:

> Of course, every company wants to hire talented people to work for them. However, being talented is an art in which there must be voluntary work and enthusiasm for the work of the devotees.... Google, Apple, Netflix, and Dell are 40% more productive than the average company which attracts top-tier employees and high performers (Vozza 2017)

That's the secret -- if you're enthusiastic about a particular space, you tend to be more productive working in that space. So if a company wants employees to achieve maximum productivity, they have to find those spaces where the employees are most engaged. The process of finding the right space doesn't just being when you onboard -- it begins during the hiring process. After you get hired, you begin the process of team matching. I met with the leaders of five different teams before choosing the one I did (and also relocating to Seattle in the process).

After joining the right team, I spent a good month just onboarding and learning about various groups and products within the team's stewardship. Then a writer I was working with transitioned to another group, leaving a clear gap where she'd been previously working. This gap involved documentation for external partners and was organized in a developer portal -- two qualities I realized I really enjoyed in docs.

Additionally, the product domain was with auto, which is undergoing a major industry disruption as cars transition to software-driven and operated components. I liked working in disruptive spaces, especially with hands-on products (using hardware interfaces where you flash builds and can push buttons and so on). This is part of why I'd liked working in the devices group at Amazon, installing builds onto Fire TV and other devices, like Echo Show, and then seeing apps and services work. It took a while to recognize it, but things soon snapped into focus at Google: I'd found a place I felt comfortable and could tap into more of my natural interests and curiosities.

## Flipping the perspective: the writing/thinking process versus the subject

Although finding the right product domain is important, I'm confident that the subject matters much less than the way you approach it. Regardless of the product domain, I'm much more interested in writing itself. As a kid, when I would come home from school and my dad would ask me about my day, if I said a class was boring, he would always tell me, "Tommy, it's not the subject that's boring, it's the teacher!" He said this so many times that I learned to avoid saying that any class was boring.

No matter the subject, an insightful, curious writer can bring that subject to life. The topic is less important than the act of writing itself -- asking questions, researching what's been written, laying out a hypothesis, testing it out, iterating on what works, reflecting on what doesn't, etc. Francis Bacon's most important discovery wasn't any scientific principle; it was the scientific method (which ironically proved far more valuable than any of this scientific conclusions).

I took my father's lesson to heart as a grad student composition teacher at Columbia. I remember telling my students a similar line of thinking, and one outspoken student challenged me to demonstrate it. He picked up a half-broken walnut on the ground and asked how that walnut could be interesting. I looked at the walnut for about 5 seconds, saw the partial ink imprint of a logo, and immediately started asking about the feeding of squirrels on campus should be allowed, as many people believe squirrels are pests similar to rats and shouldn't be encouraged. In only 5 minutes, the whole class was debating the feeding of squirrels! (This was probably the greatest moment of my brief composition teaching career.)

At some layer or perspective, most topics can be interesting, even puppies. (Think about the psychological phenomenon of including puppies in slide decks, for example. Apparently, it's an easy way to win sympathy from your audience.) Part of the task of writing is to identify the facets of subjects that are interesting, controversial, and in need of analysis. That critical inquiry is the valuable activity here, not the subject itself. It's the mind thinking that's interesting, not the thoughts themselves. Think about Descartes *Meditations*. Convoluted as the arguments are, that's not what makes the work a masterpiece. It's the way he captures a mind thinking, and how that portrayal reinforces his actual *cogito, ergo sum* argument ("I think, therefore I am").

## Conclusion

At any rate, finding the right focus might be a balance of the two -- just like the advice everyone gives to kids about finding the right career. Find something that interests you but also pays enough to make a living. The same might be said for writing focuses -- find something that interests you but which also has enough dividends for the effort to be worth it.
