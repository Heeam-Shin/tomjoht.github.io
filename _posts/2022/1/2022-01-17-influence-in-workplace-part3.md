## Initial attempts at workplace content

In my initial attempt to create content in the workplace, I forgot everything I learned on the web and instead tried to leverage common patterns of communication in the workplace. I focused on two efforts: (1) creating documentation reports/newsletters and (2) sharing meeting notes.

## Documentation reports and meeting notes

I started creating documentation reports because a senior leader wanted them, as most groups that reported to him submitted reports of some kind. I was more than willing to assemble and share reports about documentation because I wanted docs to be seen as an equal with the other groups.

Then later, I started sharing meeting notes as well. I wrote about these two formats and practices here:

* [Sending doc status reports -- a tool for visibility and relationship building](/learnapidoc/docapis_status_reports.html)
* [Broadcasting your meeting notes to influence a wider audience](/learnapidoc/docapis_meeting_notes.html#what-if-sensitive-topics-are-discussed-during-the-meeting)

At first, I thought these communications were working well. However, because I was just sending this content over email, it was hard to track opens and reads. Occasionally, someone would reply "Thanks Tom" or "Great report" or similar. I sent monthly doc reports diligently for about six months, and meeting notes after about 7 or 8 meetings. I made sure the distribution included both meeting participants and other non-participants who I deemed relevant, with the intent of keeping others informed about doc efforts and status.

## Low engagement

I had high hopes for engagement from meeting notes, since I'd spent time adding many more details and context to make them understandable to those outside the meeting. However, I didn't see much evidence of engagement, and then someone also told me that the meeting notes might not be getting the readership I wanted. I decided to do a test.

Instead of putting all the content into the email, I instead listed bullet points of the meeting topics discussed, followed by a link to the meeting notes in a Google Doc. I used a linktracker to gauge clicks on the link.

It turns out my colleague was right -- only about 5 people actually clicked the link (about the same number in the meeting). This made me rethink the type of content that others might find engaging. I realized that meeting notes were probably a low-value form of content, and probably not worth the effort of the more detailed writeup and summarizing of issues that I'd been doing.

I also started to rethink the readership of the documentation reports as well. These reports were getting long (and newslettery), and I hadn't been getting much feedback on them either. What if the reads were equally abysmal, just like meeting notes? What if I was spending an inordinate amount of time preparing doc reports that no one was reading?

## The failure of email as a communication channel for everything

A colleague also explained that email might not be the best format for this content, since many people's inboxes were just streams of unread email from the dozens of lists or groups they follow. Email tends to get overused in corporations as a means of communicating everything.

Content sent in email was likely not having the reach, but I suspected it was more than just the format. It was the content focus itself -- documentation wasn't really interesting to others, it seemed. I decided I needed to return to the drawing board to rethink my approach.

In distributing content in the workplace, I had forgotten all the techniques that I'd learned on the web with my blog. Stuffing all content into a long read, sending only an email rather than leading people back to a website, not actively tracking links or web page analytics, not organizing the content on any navigable site for later readers -- it's no wonder my approach didn't have much success.

## Communication mediums in corporations

Despite the failure of these doc reports and meeting notes formats, I hardly fault myself. I was simply following the same conventions that nearly any group does inside the corporation -- stuffing all updates into a long email and blasting it out. Different spaces have different communication mediums, and inside the corporation, this was the expected form and delivery.

Part of the reason I didn't incorporate any blog techniques is because blogs inside corporations are practically nonexistent. But there is a format that is common, and it's highly similar to blogs: newsletters. Just as blogs comprise much of the fabric of the web, newsletters are the staple of corporate communications.

Newsletter content contains a variety of info, from light and personal information such as employee spotlights, org announcements, and informational tidbits to more substantial information, product deep dives, strategic directions, tech tips, and explanations of initiatives to keep employees informed about what's going on at a company.

Sending newsletters is a practice companies have followed not only in the last century, but apparently for the last 2,000 years. In *An analysis of the corporate newsletter as a form of internal and external communication*, Cole traces the first newsletter ("news and letters") back to ancient China, specifically to the "Han Dynasty in 200 b.c. for fast communication between cities."

Cole's analysis is actually a 200-page master's thesis on newsletters, which she published in 1993 (before the widespread emergence of the internet). I had no idea that newsletters had such a rich and dominant history in corporations. Cole analyzes both external newsletters and internal newsletters.

## External newsletters

An external newsletter's purpose is usually to raise awareness and interest in the company's products and services. Cole says "a newsletter is effective if it can attract the reader's eye towards certain advertised products or services." The newsletter often "wins clients because the newsletters portrays its company as a leader in the field with a good reputation." Even though the focus is on building relationships with customers, any org that sends out a newsletter might have similar goals of increasing the appeal of the org's products and services.

The approach in external newsletters isn't entirely marketing collateral, though. Long before "content marketing strategies" became popular, companies that sent out newsletters realized that they needed to provide valuable content to customers, not just marketing collateral. Cole writes:

> A frequent, cynical response when someone receives an external newsletter in the mail is most likely, "Oh, they're just trying to sell me something." Knowing the consumer's aversion to the "hard sell," most external newsletter editors hire design agencies which disguise the marketing content with pictures, distracting designs and "objective" writing. Their desire is to draw in the skimmer, invite him to read on. The key to pulling the skimmer into reading the copy is in convincing him that the content of the newsletter is full of information that is relevant and helpful to him. Anne Murphy advises this in the Inc. article "The Best Newsletters in America": "To get read, a newsletter must add value by informing the reader. . . The moral: Let the sales literature tout the products" (72).

In other words, avoid the overt messaging in sales literature, and instead look to provide value to the readers. Recognize that through the newsletter, you are promoting an image, a brand, communicating with the audience, and remaining visible. The strategy behind content marketing is similar: provide valuable content to the reader to build a relationship; don't just try to sell a product.

## Internal newsletters

Internal newsletters might not be promoting products and services, but they are promoting something nonetheless: the company to the employees. In research about the purpose of corporate newsletters, Cole highlights these top 5 reasons for newsletters in companies:

> * Improving morale and fostering goodwill between employees and
management.
> * Informing employees about internal changes;
> * Explaining compensation and benefit plans;
> * Changing employee behavior toward becoming more productive; and
> * Changing employee behavior toward becoming more quality
oriented (Troy 6).

Company leaders use newsletters as a tool for internal communication, making the newsletter not just a recent way of sharing news but also developing relationships with employees and others around them. The goal of newsletters is to make employees feel included, to build goodwill, to help them be more productive and informed.

Here's the part that surprises me, though. Whereas on the web, most newsletters consist of individual website articles that bring readers back to websites, in the corporation, newsletters almost always live in email inboxes. The emails contain all the content -- there aren't usually any links taking readers out to internal websites. As such, it's hard to track what employees are reading in these newsletters, and if you miss the newsletter, you simply miss the content.

You also can't search for the newsletter content on corporate search engines. If you arrived at the company after the newsletter was sent, you usually can't browse the newsletter archive. If there is an archive, it's likely a list of PDFs that look about as appealing to read as yesterday's news.

## Following common patterns

Despite the shortcomings of the newsletter format, I think it's important to leverage standard formats that are recognized as valid sources of information sharing in companies. Blogs aren't common within companies, but newsletters are. Is there really a difference? I'd argue that a good newsletter, one that communicates substantial information in candid ways, could move beyond the corporate limitations of email inbox delivery and intransigence and be hosted on an internal site, highly similar to a blog.

The problem with the word "blog" is that many people interpret blogs as casual diaries about the mundane aspects of lives no one cares about. In reality, the web is full of all kinds of sites, from the mundane self-focused blogs like I described to websites that seem more like online magazines or information centers than anything else.

## Information delivery failures

Another failure with newsletters inside corporations is using email as the delivery mechanism. In my personal email, I get about 20 messages a day. In my work email, I get at least 200, if not more. I subscribe to a lot of different groups, most of which are filtered into various folders automatically and skip the inbox. But even my inbox is a firehose of incoming information. If I see an email in the evening, chances are I won't be able to find it in the morning. If an email arrives in the morning, I probably won't be able to locate it in the afternoon. It's really that bad, and I don't even receive the degree of email that others do.

Given the limitations of email, it makes sense to get users interacting with that information outside of the email. The email can provide short summaries that bring users to a website, and on that website, readers can more easily browse content, save pages, share links, and more. Content on internal sites is also indexed in corporate search indexes.

## Next steps

I knew that I'd failed with my doc reports and meeting notes. But rather than throw in the towel, I resolved to pivot my approach, to rearchitect the information using all the web techniques I described in the previous post. There was just one thing I couldn't quite figure out: the content. If people fundamentally weren't interested in documentation topics, much less meta documentation, and this was my only knowledge and experience, then how could I ever create content that would have any reach, even in the right format?
