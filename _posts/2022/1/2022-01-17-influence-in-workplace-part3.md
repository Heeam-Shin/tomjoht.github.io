## Initial attempts at workplace content

In my initial attempt to create content in the workplace, I focused on creating documentation reports and sharing meeting notes. I started creating documentation reports because a senior leader wanted them, and I was more than willing to assemble and share them. Then later, a space opened up where a variety of groups could share meeting notes (with the purpose of helping keep everyone informed), so I started sharing meeting notes as well. I wrote about these two formats and practices here:

* [Sending doc status reports -- a tool for visibility and relationship building](/learnapidoc/docapis_status_reports.html)
* [Broadcasting your meeting notes to influence a wider audience](/learnapidoc/docapis_meeting_notes.html#what-if-sensitive-topics-are-discussed-during-the-meeting)

However, as I was just sending this content over email, it was hard to track opens and reads. Occasionally someone replied "Thanks" or "Great report" or similar. But after a colleague told me that the meeting notes might not be getting the readership I want, I needed to do a test. Instead of putting all the content into the email, I instead listed bullet points of the topics discussed, followed by a link to the meeting notes in a Google Doc.

It turns out my colleague was right -- only about 5 people actually clicked the link (about the same number in the meeting). This made me rethink the type of content that others might find engaging. I realized that meeting notes were probably a low-value form of content, and probably not worth the effort of the more detailed writeup and summarizing of issues that I'd been doing.

I also started to rethink the readership of the documentation reports as well. These reports were getting long, and I hadn't been getting much feedback on them. What if the reads were equally abysmal, just like meeting notes?

My colleague also explained that email might not be the best format for this content, as many people's inboxes were just streams of unread email from the dozens of lists or groups they follow. My email was likely not having the reach, but I suspected it was more than just the format. It was the content focus itself -- documentation wasn't really interesting to others, it seemed. I decided I needed to return to the drawing board to rethink my approach.

In distributing content in the workplace, I seemed to have forgotten all the techniques that I'd learned on the web with my blog. Stuffing all content into a long read, sending only an email rather than leading people back to a site, not actively tracking links or looking at analytics -- it's no wonder the approach didn't have much success.

But rather than throw in the towel, I resolved to pivot my approach, to rearchitect the approach using all the web techniques I described in the previous post. There was just one thing I couldn't quite figure out: the content. If people fundamentally weren't interested in documentation topics, much less meta documentation, and this was my only knowledge and experience, then how could I ever create content that would have any reach?
