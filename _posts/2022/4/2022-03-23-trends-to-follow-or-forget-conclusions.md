description: "This post is <a href='/trends/trends-to-follow-or-forget-intro.html'>part of a series</a> that explores tech comm trends that I've either followed or forgotten, and why. The overall goal is to better understand the reasons that drive trend adoption or abandonment in my personal career. This is the final post in the series and tries to draw some conclusions about the observations of the previous 15 trends explored."

## Overview

One of the goals of this series was to analyze how we think about trends in an inductive way, based on a core set of raw experiences, and see what general observations come from the analysis of these trends. In this post, I'll make some general statements that come from patterns with the previous trends.

## 1. What makes sense in one context might not make sense in another

One practice might make sense for certain contexts but not others. For example:

* In some cases (mostly internal docs) wikis make sense, but not in others (such as crowdsourcing commercial docs about yet-to-be-released features).
* Or take faceted filtering. If you have a ton of information that has clear attributes about versions, languages, models, locales, operating systems, and domains, then a faceted filtering tool would make sense. On the other hand, if you don't have clear facets for your information, faceted filtering will likely fail.
* If you're writing for developers are you're one writer allocated to 1,000 developers, a docs-as-code makes sense because you'll need developers to contribute to the docs. On the other hand, if you're in a pharmaceutical industry writing heavily regulated content on a team of specialized biomedical SMEs, a docs-as-code system probably won't make sense.

Whether a trend continues or fizzles depends on the context for the writing scenario. A writer typically switches companies every 5 years or less, and with this switch comes a change in the product, domain, audience, context, restrictions, expectations, workflow, and so on. It's no wonder that what tools and practices might have worked at one company might no longer apply to the next. Did the tool or practice (once heralded as a trend) fail? No, the context changed and the trend may have become irrelevant in that context.

## 2. Easier tools won't make non-writers willingly start writing docs

There's a recurring idea that if we just make the tools easy enough to use, more people will start contributing to docs. This is true to an extent. By using doc-as-code tools within developer contexts, and using the same workflows for making changes, reviewing those changes, and submitting the change as code, developers can more easily plug in to writing scenarios.

However, unless it's the developer's job to write, chances are they won't dig in to writing tasks in a deep way. More commonly, developers will make small updates here and there, such as changing a parameter on a page, or copying and pasting a code example. Think changes on a sentence or paragraph level. Rarely do non-writers contribute entirely new topics or make substantial overhauls of content.

With docs-as-code tools, I've seen the workflow mostly ignored by the majority of developers, who usually realize that either writing doesn't come naturally to them, or more likely, writing is a lot of work and they don't want to exert this energy, especially given that they're still probably working on code.

With wikis for external docs, the same phenomenon happens. Just because it's easy to edit a page, that doesn't make it easy to write. To write content, you need familiarity with the product, you need confidence about how it works and a fluidity to articulate something that is complex in a simple way. There's a reason companies hire professional technical writers -- writing technical documentation is a lot of work.

You need to gather information through interviews, meetings, source documents, trial and error, and other meetings. You need to organize the information into a coherent, mostly task-based form. You need to meticulously work on every detail in an exacting way, especially going through the steps yourself to make them work in every condition, etc. If you're really good, you ferret out all the error messages and document them too, etc.

In short, writing is hard work. People don't just start writing good docs because you made the tools easier. If it were the case, then the launch of Google Docs would have made many would-be novelists immediately famous because they suddenly had an easy way to write the novels that were trapped in their heads.

## 3. You're less likely to outgrow tools that are flexible, customizable, and hackable

Although the web CMS simplified many aspects of website management, nothing beats plain text files when you're working in an enterprise setting. Plain text files fit well within any Git workflows. The text files can be scripted into build workflows, pushed and pulled from one server to the next, and integrated into systems, templates, or other tools in an easy way. As such, it's hard to outgrow them. Whatever your obstacle, you can usually hack a solution to make it work.

In contrast, more fixed tools can frustrate users when they don't accommodate a scenario, and there's nothing you can do to change or alter the tool -- it's just a black box that is completely closed.

Even putting aside tools, information models that require strict adherence to rules can frustrate writers. What if you want to combine certain types, or break the rules to accommodate a particular scenario? If you can't do this, you might grow frustrated and abandon the approach, arguing that the IA is problematic.

## 4. To assess trends related to titles and roles, look at job postings



## 5. Trends start on the web before they make their way into tech comm

## 6. If you're working with developers, following their workflows, tools, and processes helps you connect with their world

## Using these principles to evaluate trends we're unsure about

Can these principles be leveraged to evaluate whether remote work is here to stay, and will fundamentally transform the workplace?

- look at job ads. most companies seem to be embracing hybrid at some point.
- look at the web first. look at tech workers, not within tech comm. we generally follow tech.
- if devs are remote, you'll want to follow their same workflows to stay in step. using online tools rather than in-person meetings.
- outsourcing didn't entirely displace tech comm in the past, so would it in the future?


ramifications of remote work:
- not limited to employers in your area. want that job working for a company that builds cyclocomputers or something? probably available.
- easier for companies to hire you for a job at will, then let you go at will. if the pool of candidates is the entire world, lots more competition globally. and for someone living in an inexpensive place, the cost of the work will matter. $60/hour doesn't do much in an expensive city where that's how much a dinner will cost you. But what if you live in a place where $60/hour will get you dinner for an entire week? this will mean that people living in expensive areas will be outbid for writing contacts.
- our work is almost entirely online. there aren't really in-person brainstorming sessions where someone is whiteboarding something. since most is online, this whole model transfers easily to digital worlds. ripe for the metaverse?
- pace can move faster. easier to hire a team in another country to get the work done.
- next several years will be critical. if remote work companies outperform hybrid or in-office models, you'll see others follow suit to compete. and then you'll really be in an interesting situation.
- loss of company culture, no strong sense of team, loyalty, never even met colleagues in person. lack of engagement and identification with company
- are our jobs under threat from workers in other countries who normally wouldn't be competitive b/c they lacked resources to be near the company but who now are equally available in the digital landscape?
- what if tech writing becomes like task rabbit going to the highest bidder, like a wordpress theme or something from someone in china
