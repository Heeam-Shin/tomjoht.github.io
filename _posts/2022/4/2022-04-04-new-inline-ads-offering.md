Inline appear directly within the post body. They also include an article link below the graphic. Here's an example:

{% include ads.html %}

For more details, see [Inline ads](/advertising/#inlineads) on my Advertising info page.

I introduced this new ad space because I think the sidebar is becoming less noticeable to readers. People tend to see only what's in the post body, so the inline ads are more inline with content. Inserting an ad into the post body required me to manually add a tag to every single post and page on my site, which required quite a bit of time.

For readers who hate ads, sorry, yes these inline ads are more intrusive to reading. However, they aren't interstitial ads that suddenly expand to fill the entire screen, nor are they annoying popups that have an invisible close button. The ads are related to tech comm products and services and hopefully aren't worse than an occasional commercial on TV. (If you really dislike ads, you can read content through [getpocket.com](https://getpocket.com/).)

For company marketers, if you have a tech comm product or service that you'd like to make more visible to tech writers, consider an inline ad. I also have other advertising options available as well, which you can read about on my [Advertising](/advertising) page. Feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/) with any questions.
