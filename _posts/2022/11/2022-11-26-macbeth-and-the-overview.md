In my previous post, [Pulling readers through long documents](https://idratherbewriting.com/trends/reading-long-documents.html), I explained that almost no one will read long documents, in my experience. It seems only task-based information demands enough payoff to make reading worth it to users. In this post, I'll explore a couple of examples where high-level information seems essential and used. The two examples are Macbeth and Elon Musk.

## Macbeth {#macbeth}

The other week my daughter Callie, a senior in high school, came home stressed out about an enormous reading log for *Macbeth*. The reading log included dozens of questions about the author, context, plot, key quotations, interpretation, and more. Yet as my daughter tried to read *Macbeth*, they found it incomprehensible.

I remember reading *Macbeth* in high school and memorizing the "double, double toil and trouble" passage, but I couldn't recall the plot at all. And as I looked at the *Macbeth* text my daughter had, with its many footnotes and explanations inserted on each page, I could see that reading it from start to finish, as one would normally approach a novel, wouldn't work well. If you have to read a footnote for practically every line in the text, how can you ever make much progress?

Fortunately, my wife, who never neglects to remind me that she took five AP classes in high school and received perfect 5's on each of them, told them  they shouldn't start with the text but rather at a high-level overview. "You don't just start reading the text," she said. "Start by reading the Wikipedia entry so you get an idea of the plot, the important characters and themes. Or read some high-level Cliff's Notes." 

But then in another instant, she had a better idea: Youtube. My wife searched Youtube for "macbeth" and in no time we were all watching [Macbeth in 7 minutes](https://youtu.be/4GSCWDa1qcE):

I could see light bulbs going on in my daughter's head and their stress melting away. The 7-minute overview gave us a sense of the main characters, general plot, and major themes in a matter of minutes.

After this video, we watched [5 longer explanatory videos from Psycho English Teacher on Macbeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGemg1hd9sM). Here's her summary of Act 1:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGemg1hd9sM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We followed this with similar videos from the same for Act 2, 3, 4, and 5. This took 45 minutes in all, but both my daughter and I watched with full attention. All the pieces of *Macbeth* were assembling in place, and by the end of the videos, my daughter felt a thousand percent more confident about the assignment. Psycho English Teacher has a penchant for stripping down this complex text and plot into easy-to-understand language and actions. (She would have made an excellent technical writer.)

After this night, I never saw my daughter stressed out over the *Macbeth* assignment. They eventually made her way into the primary text, pulled out various quotations, and completed most of the reading log. Sadly, I don't think they ended up reading the entire text, but enough to complete the assignment. When they did read, they had enough grounding from the high-level overview that they could make sense of the text, in spite of the Shakespearean language.

This experience confirmed the importance of the high-level overview, but it also illuminated exactly when this is needed: in times of complexity and length. In this case, the high-level overview provided a shortcut for the reader. Instead of having to slog through 200 pages of Shakespearean English and confusing plot lines, the high-level overview distilled the essential information in consumable ways. 

In this way, the high-level overview provided an easier path to the user's end goal. This benefit stands in contrast to the high-level technical overview that users might neglect because it exists as extra reading outside task-based docs that might be more aligned with the user's goal. In this case, a high-level overview functions more like a [quick reference guide](/trends/trends-to-follow-or-forget-quick-reference-guides.html), which is a genre I've written about previously.

In this *Macbeth* example, the high-level overview reduces the user's pain by allowing them to bypass tedious reading for a stripped down, only-what-you-need-to-know version. I remember the first time I'd made a quick reference guide, condensing a 100+ page manual into a two-page guide. The program manager came to me one day and said he was so happy that he actually cried. He felt that finally, a tech writer understood that people don't like to read lengthy documentation. He loved that the quick reference guide simplified many hours of tedious reading into bare-bones essential information.

Perhaps the takeaway here is that rather than creating high-level overviews that go into detail about the system, I should instead strive to create quick reference guides that distill more complex information down into the essentials. The end result is somewhat similar: the high-level overview encapsulates the details of the entire system in briefer, more consumable ways.

## Elon Musk and code reviews {#elon-musk}

Let's move on to the second example: Elon Musk and the Twitter architectural diagram. My colleague pointed this example out to me. A couple of weeks ago, when Elon Musk was trying to do code reviews, figure out how Twitter works, and decide what engineering resources were needed (or something), he posted this whiteboard pic of Twitter's high-level architecture:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LMAO this is a super high-level architecture diagram hastily scribbled onto a whiteboard. What code? Who falls for this?</p>&mdash; Snettles, Son of Pleasurizer (@Michael51090080) <a href="https://twitter.com/Michael51090080/status/1594019652601925632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here's an enlarged view of that high-level diagram:

<a href=""><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/twitter-musk-high-level-architecture2.jpg" alt="High-level diagram of Twitter's architecture" /></a>

Whether this architecture was useful for the new CEO's decision-making, or whether it's real purpose was to project Musk's narcissistic CEO mythology as a tech-savvy leader, this is beside the point. The point is that this high-level architecture is the starting point that Elon Musk felt to be necessary for understanding code and other decision-making. Without it, the lines and lines of programming code, engineering teams, and Twitter functionality had no context or larger meaning. 

Even putting aside the many controversies surrounding Elon Musk and Twitter, most engineers in all tech companies start at a similar level as well. When you join a new team or take stewardship of a new technology, it's natural to seek a high-level diagram and overview of the system.

Interestingly, I'm guessing this high-level architecture at Twitter wasn't already documented. (I keep wondering whether Musk kept any technical writers at Twitter or whether he considered them non-essential personnel, despite the irony of this high-level documentation being one of his first requests.)

For many engineers, a high-level diagram satisfies the need for written documentation. Perhaps when you see the pieces on the board, it's enough for engineers to understand how it all fits together, without supplementing the diagram with tedious explanations. In contrast, for non-engineers, maybe they need the additional detail. 

A lot could be said for creating high quality diagrams. I haven't run across too much in techcomm literature that dives into best practices here. But some common best practices for high-level architectural diagrams might include the following:

* **Choose an appropriate level of detail**. The diagram here is fairly simple, though I'm guessing that engineers could have made it look more like one of those unintelligible football plays that have chaotic spaghetti arrows and lines going everywhere. Maybe each of the boxes here could have its own more granular architectural diagram of complexity, but that level is abstracted away into a single box at this level.
* **Communicate a logical flow with the arrows.** Where does information start and where does it end? The eye should have some natural focus through the diagram. In this example, it seems that the action starts on the left and moves toward the middle end elsewhere. There are dotted lines going to some services (to indicate optional paths?). I don't see many bidirectional arrows. But if you trace the directional flow, it's somewhat intelligible, even with no familiarity with Twitter.
* **Provide more detail about each component if the user wants it**. It could be that for many engineers, this high-level is all that's needed. But suppose you want more information about the "Home Ranker" box. This seems like an interesting algorithm that I'd like to know more about. How can you take the reader to more detail here? That flow of progressive information is surely provided in quality documentation.

Similar to the *Macbeth* example, here the high-level diagram saves the CEO many hours of time that would otherwise be spent reading more specialized and granular code. Instead of trying to sort through endless code repositories and APIs, the CEO can see at a glance all the pieces and how they fit together. This workflow provides the semantic hierarchy of each piece, showing that some components (e.g., the "Timeline Mixer") have greater importance that then "service graph" or "EarlyBird," which are probably more marginal services.

The takeaway here is to focus more on good diagramming techniques and best practices rather than writing out a longwinded explanation of each component and providing more narrative detail.

If you wanted to provide more detail, the diagram here could provide links to further reading. Adding links to each box could easily be done through Adobe Illustrator. 

When I was at Amazon, I once documented an XML schema by doing something similar. See [Movie Elements](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/catalog/movie-elements.html), for example: 

<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/catalog/movie-elements.html#Offers"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/catalog-schema-elements.jpg" alt="Catalog schema documentation"/></a>

I created a tree view of the code. Then I linked each element in the tree to an explanation below. When you click a link, the explanation scrolls into focus. (I used some scroll-to jQuery plugins for the scrolling effect.) The code wasn't too complicated and could have equally been done through other approaches. But this idea is key: make the code visual and provide links for more detail from that visual diagram.

In the case of an XML schema, there wasn't a narrative flow to the elements anyway. Each element followed the same pattern of reference elements. I couldn't imagine anyone reading them linearly from start to end, so the scroll-into-focus technique seemed appropriate. But with an architectural diagram, there's more of an opportunity to create a narrative flow to the material, so jump links that put the reader into the context of a narrative (without scrolling into focus) might be more warranted.

The problem with the architectural diagram, though, is similar as before: who needs this info? What tasks prompt a user to dig into the high-level architecture? In Musk's case, although motives are murky, he appears to need the information for making hiring/firing decisions. But even this scenario seems ludicrous for a CEO, and given that the diagram didn't seem to exist previously suggests that maybe no one needs this information anyway. System-level information is only useful when making system-level changes, which are rare.

## Conclusion
