## Conditions for flow



The activity also needs to include several components. First, the activity can't be too hard or easy for your skillset. If it's too hard, the activity produces anxiety, which removes your flow. If it's too easy, it doesn't engage you enough and consequently you become bored. You have to strike a balance between anxiety and boredom such that the activity proves a good fit for your skills.

This balance is common sense. To use a basketball analogy, to enjoy the game, you need people roughly your same level of skill. If everyone is dunking over you, it's no fun, just as it's no fun if your opponent can barely dribble.

Speaking of sports, people who get into states of flow often approach the activity as a game. The activity must be constrained by rules, and you must also receive feedback about your performance.

As you sustain focus on the activity &mdash; which consumes your full attention and skills as you interact with the complex task &mdash; this focused state will organize the "psychic energy" of your mind in pleasing ways. Without a clear task, our mind tends to wander down rabbit holes, gravitating toward negative experiences and other worries. One reason we find flow-producing activities so rewarding is because of the way they give order (psychic negentropy) to what otherwise tends to be fickle, flighty thoughts (psychic entropy).

## The game

Taking Csikszentmihalyi's advice to heart here, I started looking more closely at the writing activity, looking for details that would engross me more. I started to notice a pattern in my writing that made it more game-like. I was writing longer narratives that described more holistic systems, which I described in ['Putting together things': Articulating a thesis about the effects of hyper-specialization on documentation](/trends/2022-09-18-exploiting-the-systems-view-tech-writers.html). As such, I had to read widely and try to build up details about topics I knew little about. 

My approach involved this pattern: read product design documents and other information about a topic, copying and pasting from the material I read as I found relevant nuggets or explanations. I would copy these nuggets into my draft into the appropriate sections, organizing the content by topic or by steps in a workflow. This phase was the reading phase. Reading leads to information discovery.

After accumulating enough copied/pasted nuggets in each section, I would go through that content and summarize, distill, or otherwise incorporate the important information into my own words and narrative. If the information nugget didn't need to be paraphrased or summarized, great, I could just weave it into the content as is. But usually, I had to identify a key point in a larger paragraph and paraphrase the idea in my own words.

After running out of detail, I would then revert to the reading mode, where I would uncover yet more details. After adding the newly discovered information into various sections of my draft, I would then return to my writing mode and smooth the information in, like a builder might smooth large rocks into a concrete wall through masonry.

I started to realize that I'd stumbled upon perhaps the fundamental pattern of writing. Reading and writing go hand in hand. Reading leads you to discover new information, and writing is your way of managing that information. It's like a see-saw -- read a bit, then write, then read some more, then write.

On this blog, I've noticed that each book I read gives me new ideas to explore and experiment with. Reading has been the impetus for what I write about, time and again. And in the books I read, it's clear that the authors themselves are having conversations with the sources they're reading. Writing is a conversation with what we're having with what we read.

That reading and writing fit so well together isn't a new idea, but it reinforces why so many English departments consist of both literature and writing courses. And while I've always known reading to be important, it wasn't until this past year that I began to truly experience how reading would give way to thought in writing. Seeing this pattern in my content generation process, even for the technical documentation I was writing, made my focus sessions process less strenuous. I no longer felt like I was banging my head against a blank wall. If I didn't have content, I would look for some relevant material to read, copying and pasting highlights as I ran across them. Then from these nuggets, I would add to my existing draft and keep going. If I ran out of content, I just needed to read some more.

## Why writing is so hard

Understanding the balance between reading and writing helped convert the focus sessions from a slog to more of a journey. Part of the struggle of writing is often trying to explain something that we ourselves don't fully understand. As we tax our brains to articulate an idea, process, or description that we can't fully grasp ourselves, this puts our mental wheels into overdrive. Trying to crystalize the words in our minds into some coherent, organized model is difficult. But by balancing this activity with more reading, it reduces the strain.

If you don't know what to say, read until you do. And you will most likely find that, as you're writing, you're merely having a conversation with what you've read.
