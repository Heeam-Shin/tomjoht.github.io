## Quick reference guides

Quick reference guides refer to short 1-2 page guides, attractively formatted often in multi-column layouts, that get users going with succinct descriptions of the key tasks in a software application. The idea is that users almost universally resist slogging through a long user manual and instead prefer to get up and running quickly. They often need only minimal amounts of information to get started; the rest they might figure out on their own through trial and experimentation. These quick reference guides could be printed and distributed to users at conferences, during training, attached to newsletters, or delivered in other contexts.

**Why I embraced quick reference guides: **Although I was delivering documentation through online formats, we still wanted to give the user something to get started. At the time, the popularity of video further marginalized the role of text, especially long text-based manuals, and so this quick reference format allowed us to reduce text but still provide instruction for users to get started. Most PMs loved the quick reference guides I created. One PM told me that he actually cried the first time he saw the quick reference guide I delivered – he finally felt that tech writers understood that no one wants to read long volumes of documentation.

**Why I abandoned quick reference guides: **Quick reference guides were always considered icing on the cake – not part of the core deliverables, just something extra that we provided. Instead of providing these 1-2 page PDFs, I instead gravitated more towards getting started tutorials, which could be delivered online with the rest of docs, weren’t confined to a highly styled and formatted print layout, and could include more detail, especially code samples that wouldn’t normally fit within a print layout.

**Current status: **Nearly every gadget I buy seems to come with a quick start guide, or some shorter 2-3 page setup guide rather than a long reference manual. Providing this shorter guide seems to be a common standard for many products. Within developer docs, the getting started tutorial is much more common, and it’s rarely something intended to be printed. Making information fit a print-based format often didn’t work well because most tech writers phased out of desktop publishing tools (e.g., InDesign), and wanted to put the content within the same web output as their other docs. When you put the quick reference guide online, it’s easy to simply link out to topics for more detail rather than trying to condense and summarize the information into a 1-2 page guide.
