Bobby Kennedy started offering [technical writing courses](https://becometechnicalwriter.com/) after acting as a mentor to a student trying to find a career path in tech comm. Through this experience, he realized  he has a lot of valuable information about technical writing profession, which he gained through 20+ years in the field. He can help guide students to learn both basic and advanced technical writing skills, build up a portfolio, prepare for technical writing interviews, and ultimately land a technical writing job in the field. He's even working on more specialized courses like UX writing as well.

To watch my interview with Bobby, see the video below. Note that I recorded this podcast through Zoom, and unfortunately, I didn't configure the Zoom settings correctly, so I only captured Bobby on the video, not me. (This might be preferable to viewers anyway, though.)
