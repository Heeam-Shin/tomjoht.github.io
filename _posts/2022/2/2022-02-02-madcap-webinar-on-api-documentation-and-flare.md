description: "'Using MadCap Flare to Generate API Documentation' provides an excellent introduction to API documentation, along with an example implementation in Flare. This webinar, hosted by MadCap Software, was presented by Athena Adiksson and Jana Cromer of VAS. The webinar focuses on the basics of API documentation content, not necessarily on OpenAPI specifications or integration. VAS provides a farm management API.
