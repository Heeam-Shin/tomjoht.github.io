description: "In preparation for a presentation on trends that fizzled or faded, I launched this short survey to get some help in identifying fizzled trends. The survey is still open (so feel free to take it), but I'm not longer actively monitoring the results. The <a href='https://www.questionpro.com/t/AOaGwZq7kM'>survey is here</a>. The survey has you rank the trends using sliders."

You can view the <a href='https://www.questionpro.com/t/7BnU7DZq7kM'>survey results dashboard here</a>. For my analysis of the results, see [Results of the survey about fizzled trends: Every trend is still with us](/blog/results-of-fizzled-trends-survey).

I left this survey in this series because it provides context and rationale for the direction I took. Rather than making assertions about trends across the industry, in this series I look at trends that I embraced or rejected within my own career.
