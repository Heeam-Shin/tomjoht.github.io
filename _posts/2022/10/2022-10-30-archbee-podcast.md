## The beginnings of Archbee

With the [launch of Archbee 3.0](https://www.producthunt.com/products/archbee#archbee-3-0), found Dragos Bulugean tells the story of the beginnings of Archbee:

> * Archbee v0: 2018, stuck in a hotel room in Frankfurt... it was raining and I decided to code a software diagramming tool for architects. Scrapped the product after a few months of getting no traction.
> 
> * Archbee v1: Restarted in early 2019 with the idea for an internal docs tool for eng. teams that would include API docs, markdown, diagrams, changelogs, and GitHub integration after realizing all the tools out there (Google Docs, Confluence, Notion) were built for anybody, but not tech people. The product was getting some customers organically but did not show great traction either.
> 
> * Archbee v2: This version was just an improved, better-looking, less buggy version of V1. Launched it on ProductHunt in 2020 and it got to #1. However, most of the traction was coming from a wimpy feature: publishing docs on customers' domains.
> 
> Talking to customers, we realized there are still no great tools for building public product & developer docs for folks who don't want the DIY approach. Basically, no way of onboarding and activating your tech audiences without spending a ton of energy on docs tech.

## Questions and topics

Here are some of the questions covered during the podcast:

* The initial story is cool &mdash; a developer has a need for something, doesn’t find the existing tools satisfactory, so just codes it from scratch. But just curious, with all the documentation tools available (Confluence, Docusaurus, and more), what particular task was Dragos trying to do that he couldn’t already accomplish with existing tools? Does Archbee now have some functionality for software documentation that doesn't exist in any other tools?

* Despite the relatively recent start of Archbee (v1 in early 2019), you already have a long list of customers. What feature would you say accounts for the rapid rise in customer growth for Archbee? Is Archbee filling a particular gap in the market for a specific need that other tools can’t achieve?

* Who’s your target audience for Archbee? Tech writers, engineers, or both? I see that the initial version of Archbee had the tagline “The documentation app for engineers.” You have over 100 reviews on G2 as well. Who is your target audience? 

* Archbee version 3 offers content reuse with variables and content snippets. Can you explain a bit more about what type of content can be reused? For example, can you re-use parts of the API reference in conceptual docs, such as summary descriptions?

* I’ve seen tools come and go over the years. If there’s one pattern, it’s that people identify a tooling gap for documentation scenarios, they create a tool with a lot of excitement, full of needed features, then release it with hopes that hordes of tech writers will adopt it. But then they realize that the tech comm audience is too small to be profitable. With Archbee, your audience expands beyond tech writers to also include other teams? Do you think by appealing to this wider audience you will be financially successful?
