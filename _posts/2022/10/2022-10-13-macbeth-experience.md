I recently had a family experience that reinforced the need for big picture narratives as a prerequisite for learning something complex.

The other night my oldest daughter, a senior in high school, was stressed out because their AP Lit teacher had assigned what seemed like an impossible workload related to Shakespeare's *Macbeth*. I glanced at the assignments, but the questions they had to answer actually didn't seem too bad to me. What was the issue? 

It turns out my daughter (whose pronouns are they, them) was struggling to read the Shakespearean text. Their particular version of *Macbeth* included detailed footnotes to unpack the language and add other context. Consequently, they spent too much time trying to reach each footnote in order to make their way through the text. They were only on page 15 (of 200), and they had no idea what was even going on. Hence, the reading journal questions looked impossible. The situation seemed hopeless. 

My wife piped up to say that they was going about it all wrong. Instead of starting out by reading the play, they should watch it instead. After all, plays are meant to be watched. But even before watching the play, they should watch a YouTube video to get a high-level summary so they know what's going on. That way, when they start reading the text, it will make more sense. My daughter admitted that they hadn't even read the Wikipedia article on Macbeth.

I remembered reading *Macbeth* in high school and memorizing the famous "Bubble bubble toil in trouble" passage, but beyond that I couldn't recall the plot. So my daughter and I first watched [Macbeth in 7 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GSCWDa1qcE), which introduced the plot. Then we proceeded to a 5-part video series on Macbeth by ["Psycho English Teacher"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGemg1hd9sM) that took about 40 minutes to get through. After watching these videos, we had a good sense of the plot, themes, and notable passages to look for. My daughter's stress melted away as the plot, names, and location suddenly started to come into focus.

Presumably, as my daughter starts reading the text again, additional detail will fill in even more blanks and provide a more comprehensive picture.

This experience reinforced the value of seeing the big picture. This is how we learn. When faced with a complex system of information, it helps to get the big picture before diving into the details. Get the 7-minute summary, the 40 minute summary, watch the 2 hour play, and then spend 20 hours reading each line in the book. This approach will be much better than going in the opposite direction.

We move from high-level to detail in almost every context. For example:

* When hiking a trail, you size up the trail on the map to see it as a whole before starting along it.
* When you enter a new store, you often glance around to get a sense of how big the store is, what the layout is like, and generally where things are. 
* Before starting a college course, you read through the syllabus, which provides a high-level summary, reading list, and assignments.
* Before buying a book, you read the summary on the book jacket or other reviews.
* Before watching a movie, you check out the two-minute trailer.
* Before beginning a recipe, you glance through the body of instructions and ingredients to see what it entails.

In almost every case, we move from high-level to progressively more detail. In the same way, anyone new to a system moves in a similar way: starting with the big picture, the high-level overview, before moving into progressively more detail (the API parameters and such). 

Where things go wrong for tech writers is when the engineering team tells them, *oh, the users will already know that. The users won't need an explanation of what the product is; they'll just need the Javadoc.* Why do engineers make this assumption? Because from their perspective, they're already familiar with the product. Presumably, they already got the high-level overview much earlier on, perhaps from kickoff meetings and other early design docs and discussions. 

By the time the engineers call in the tech writer, the engineers have already progressed to an advanced understanding of the product and are more focused on the nitty-gritty details. They're doing the equivalent of writing footnotes for each line in the play. Meanwhile the tech writer, presumably new to the product, has the most basic, fundamental questions about the product's purpose and definition. Like, *what is it, and what does it do?*

I'm sure if I dug into learning theories, I would find something to back up the ideas I'm arguing for here &mdash; that we learn by starting at the high-level first. If this is how we learn, then it's essential to kick off documentation journeys with the high-level views (the Macbeth in 7 minute views) that will help orient and ground the user. Failing to do so would result in the same frustrations as my daughter felt in reading *Macbeth*.
