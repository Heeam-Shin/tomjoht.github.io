description: "I recently spoke to some technical writing interns at my work on the topic of career advice. The topic was this. What advice would you give to those just starting out their technical writing career? Imagine turning back the clock 20 years. What advice would be most helpful? This post expands on some of these ideas. It also gave me an opportunity to play around with Midjourney, an art AI tool that automatically creates images based on text prompts. Unlike my other posts, this post is mostly visual, as it was intended more as a slide deck than a blog post."

## Just starting out your career

If you're just starting your career as a tech writer, this post is for you. You could be a student just graduating college, or someone who is transitioning from another career. There are many options and challenges at this point in your career.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_intro_journey.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you begin, consider this question. You've just been assigned a new project, and you have to pick another tech writer to work on it with you. You have two choices:

> Would you rather work with someone with 25 years of experience, or someone with 1 year of experience? Does it matter? Why or why not?

At these two extremes of the work experience spectrum, there are some common profiles you're no doubt familiar with. For the worker with 25 years of experience, he or she might be too set in their ways, unable to change, wed to specific tools, and often cynical and negative to the leadership around them.

Opposite to this person is one with just a couple of years of experience. This person might be mostly reactive, waiting for someone to assign him tickets, to indicate the contact points, to spell out doc needs, and other details for the work. 

Of course, these profiles are extremes. I'm exaggerating the the behaviors a bit to make a point about patterns to avoid. To make this discussion more engaging, I've given these two profiles names: Jerry (left) and Jayden (right).

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_jerry_jayden_small.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I'll focus my thoughts around how to avoid becoming Jerry and Jayden.

## Avoid becoming Jerry

Meet Jerry. He has 25 years of experience and has worked at a variety of big companies. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_jerry.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At this point in his career, Jerry has become overwhelmingly negative. What happened during during Jerry's 25 years to make him bitter? Fictitious deadlines (for which he busted his butt getting docs ready), inexplicable layoffs (some which he escaped, but not all), failed projects from poorly researched user needs (but which required enormous documentation work), CEOs oblivious to engineering best practices (and who never champion docs), and more. 

In Jerry's view, his manager and other senior leaders are incompetent. Product teams frequently loop him in at the last minute, providing little respect for the work he does. They assume he's a tech newbie, even though he has extensive code experience. Jerry hasn't devoted time to learning anything new in his field for years because everything he reads online seems so superficial. Worst of all, he has constant backaches from sitting all day. No matter the situation, even if you start out bearing good news, Jerry manages to turn it into a negative.

## When years of experience is detrimental

I start off by describing Jerry to make a point: years of experience isn't always an asset. Many times younger employees are much more desirable. 

<figure style="float:right; margin-left: 10px"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_the_fifth_discipline.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In *The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization*, Peter Senge talks with other managers at a business conference and describes what young leaders possess: 

> ...many of the more experienced managers at the conference began to see how their past knowledge and accomplishments could actually be an impediment in learning change.... By contrast, the young leaders were able to remain open, and, through their genuine inquiry, often enabled shared understanding and commitment in ways that strong advocacy can impede.... The young people work at remaining unattached to their views. (p. 371)

Young leaders are open to change, they're unattached to their views, they have genuine inquiry, and they often share commitment with others. By contrast, leaders with many years of experience might be more closed off to change (maybe they've seen it before). Their previous experiences might have persuaded them about certain views (not this again), and they might have little interest in deviating from what they found to work in previous roles and situations (what's the point of doing it differently when this way works?). 

As you progress through your career, how will you avoid the same trajectory as Jerry? It's easy when you're just starting out and haven't had to deal with all the nonsense that Jerry has been dealing with for years. The trick is to retain some of the youthful attributes even as life wears on you for the next twenty years.

Many tech workers have anxiety about getting older. In San Francisco, there's even a camp people can attend to deal with becoming "old." In [New Luxury Retreat Caters to Elderly Workers in Tech (Ages 30 and Up)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/modern-elder-resort-silicon-valley-ageism.html), the author explains:

> In and around San Francisco, the conventional wisdom is that tech jobs require a limber, associative mind and an appetite for risk &mdash; both of which lessen with age.... Their anxieties are well founded. In Silicon Valley, the hiring rate seems to slow for workers once they hit 34 .... 
> 
> The social narrative is basically, midlife is a crisis and after a crisis you have decrepitude,” Mr. Conley said. “But you actually are much happier in your 60s and 70s, so why aren’t we preparing for that?” 

I wrote about this fear in a post here: [Confronting the fear of growing older when you're surrounded by young programmers](/2019/03/07/confronting-fears-of-aging-in-technology-environments/). Youth have the advantage of naturally possessing a more limber mind, making new connections, and having an appetite for risk, to take the big swing.

In my post, I conducted a survey asking whether others felt any anxiety about increasing in years, and what they're doing to stay young. 73% agree or strongly agree with the this statement: 

> I sometimes fear what will happen as I get older in the technology field.

When asked what people do to stay young, the top results (from 140 respondents) were as follows: 

1. Experimenting with new ideas or techniques (109)
2. Changing my perspective to see things differently (93)
3. Constantly reading (92)
4. Questioning what I think I already know (84)

(You can see the [full survey results here](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PFd5IZd2F8).)

## Five ways to stay young (even as life wears on you)

Based on the trends in the survey and my own experiences, I recommend these five ways to stay young: 

1. Read
2. Experiment
3. Ask questions
4. See mental models
5. Take risks

### 1. Read

Reading introduces you to new information, which helps you continue learning. Continuing to learn helps you keep an open mind and stay receptive to new information that might contradict existing information you have. 

In reading, focus on high-value content, such as books, journal articles, or in-depth articles. Scrolling Twitter and other social media feeds involves reading but the information is often low-value.

Without any incoming information through reading, we will continue operating on our existing knowledge and experiences. We'll be more likely to remain fixed and repeat our same strategies again and again. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_read.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 2. Experiment

Experimenting with new techniques, tactics, tools, and processes can be a way to expose you to new information as well. The experiments might change previous assumptions or lead you to new epiphanies or other insights. 

When I did my [smartphone experiment](/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/) and gave up my smartphone for a time, it led to many new ideas and feelings. Another experiment, [moving from WordPress to Jekyll](/2015/05/29/moved-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/), and then [adopting docs-as-code tools for documentation](/2018/07/03/docs-as-code-after-three-years/), likewise led to many new realizations and ideas. 

In this post, I'm experimenting with a new tool for creating images: [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com). Using AI led me to question some techno-skeptic trends that I'd recently been following, and I started to believe that maybe anything is possible with tech. Perhaps I just wasn't patient enough.

Experimentation should naturally follow from reading. If you're learning new ideas from the books you're reading, try them out. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_experiment.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 3. Ask questions

Asking questions is also key to retaining a young, open mindset. When you ask a question, you move in the direction of the unknown to the known, and it can sometimes be exciting to uncover new ways of looking at the world. 

When we start asking questions, we often come to realize how little we know. The most mundane, taken-for-granted topic can turn upside down with the right question. What we frequently forget is how little we know. It's only when we start asking questions that we recognize our lack of knowledge. The most basic, almost fact-like idea can seem perplexing with the right question.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_ask_questions.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In asking questions, be sure to turn the questions onto yourself as well, questioning your own assumptions and beliefs. Asking questions helps you retain your curiosity and inquisitive mind. It helps you avoid defensiveness and myopia.

Asking questions about whether there are "non-trends," or trends that have fizzled, led me to an entire series of posts called [Trends to follow or forget](/trends/trends-to-follow-or-forget-intro.html). 

Questions also help you build personal skills. Have you ever talked to someone who never asks you questions of any kind? These one-sided "conversations" are my least favorite.

For more posts on asking questions, see these two:

* [Asking questions is more important than finding answers -- why?](/2012/04/27/asking-questions-is-more-important-than-finding-answers-why/)
* [The art of asking questions](/2010/02/17/the-art-of-asking-questions/)

### 4. See mental models

Mental models are the stories people tell themselves to make sense of the world. Peter Senge says mental models constitute one of the four disciplines in a learning organization:

> Two people with different mental models can observe the same event and describe it differently, because they’ve looked at different details and made different interpretations.” (164)

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_mental_models.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I had a recent family experience that reinforced the importance of mental models. One of my daughters had been complaining about another girl at school who was rallying others against her. One time a friend, this girl had since turned into a major friction point. To my surprise, the girl's mother reached out to us one day to complain that our daughter and others were more or less bullying this girl. *What?* I wanted to say it was the opposite.

But my wife asked to see the Discord threads that were at the heart of the friction between the two. As she looked through the exchanges, there was some evidence that my daughter had acted in appropriately. Looking at the data started to change our views. It also helped my daughter see her actions from another perspective as well. 

This is the beauty of thinking about mental models: it frees you from the idea that events have only one interpretation. We tell ourselves stories that make sense of the events and experiences of our lives.

To get a better sense of mental models, Senge recommends these strategies:

> Ask ‘What is the ‘data’ on which this generalization is based?” Then ask yourself, “Am I willing to consider that this generalization may be inaccurate or misleading?’ (180) 
> 
> Actively inquire into others’ views that differ from your own  (i.e., ‘What are your views?’ ‘How did you arrive at your view?’ ‘Are you taking into account data that are different from what I have considered?’ (p. 186)

In other words, look at the data that gives rise to the stories you tell yourself, and then ask if there's another way to interpret the data. By seeking out different ways to interpret data, it helps you keep an open mind and stay unattached to your views.

### 5. Take risks

The final recommendation is perhaps the hardest: take risks. I'm a cautious person in most areas of my life, from driving to sports, finances, and more. When I worked at Amazon for nearly 5 years, I could feel that I was starting to get too comfortable. Things were becoming automatic for me. I felt like I could stay in my position for 10-15 years. 

Even though it was uncomfortable, I decided to take a big leap in not only [switching to a new company](/blog/job-transition-from-amazon-to-google/) (Google), but also [relocating to a new state](/blog/seattle-one-year-later) (from California to Washington). We even [bought a house we'd never actually seen](/blog/moving-to-seattle-exploring-places-with-vr) in person! It all worked out, fortunately.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_take_risks.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Why does taking risks keep us young? Think of the analogy to company innovation. Clay Christiansen talks about why big companies, seemingly thriving and dominant for a time, can suddenly be overtaken by a much smaller company. The reason? The large, established company invests in sustaining innovations (small improvements to their existing technology), while the smaller company operates in stealth mode and takes a swing at disruptive innovations. Eventually, the disruptive innovations hit a maturity point that they put the larger company out of business. I wrote a whole series of posts about this here: [Sustaining and disruptive innovations](/2015/02/10/sustaining-and-disruptive-innovations/).

Our careers operate the same way. It's easier to make small improvements, but sometimes the disruptive innovations in our lives can yield large improvements. My [API doc course](/learnapidoc/) brought me tremendous visibility and has been successful from many points of view (workshops, advertising, feedback from others). 

But at the start of this year, as I [reflected on the previous year](/blog/seattle-one-year-later#whats-next--rekindling-more-blogging-energy), I realized I wanted to double-down on some writing projects and techniques that I've been thinking about for years. I want to write essays following a common theme, and connect those essays together into published books. The time required to do this, however, would mean less time devoted to my API doc site maintaining and improving the content there. I decided to take the risk of devoting 2022 to seeing these projects through. I have three series I'm working on: 

* [Trends to follow or forget](/trends/trends-to-follow-or-forget-intro.html)
* [Journey away from smartphones](/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/)
* [A hypothesis about influence on the web and the workplace](/web-and-workplace-influence/part1-introduction-to-influencers.html)

It's now August and I'm hoping to bring at least one of the series to completion by the year's end. 

<hr/>

Before finishing this section, I want to conclude with one of my favorite quotes. Picasso said, "It takes a long time to become young." The ability to read constantly, experiment regularly, ask questions, and take risks involve lifelong attributes to develop and cultivate. 

## Avoid becoming Jayden

Meet Jayden! Jayden has one year of experience. He recently graduated from college and even had an internship. He's new, so he's still learning a lot. But in his current state, he needs a lot of handholding. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_jayden.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Jayden mostly waits for tickets to be assigned to him. If no one assigns him tickets, he doesn't seek out the work. As a junior writer, he mostly operates in listen mode. He has good writing skills, but he needs most of the information collected for him. He has a hard time reaching out to different stakeholders to set up meetings and pull information out of engineer's heads. Jayden has a good personality and people enjoy chatting with him, but he requires a lot of management to be productive.

## Five ways to level up past novice mode

To level up past novice mode, I recommend five strategies:

1. Learn to figure out what work needs to be done
2. Turn off phone/chat notifications
3. Give reviewers time to read the doc in review meetings
4. Find interest through specialization
5. Use writing to influence stakeholders

### Learn to figure out what work needs to be done

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_proactive.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first strategy is adopt a sense of proactiveness about the work. The shift from reactive to proactive constitutes the core principle of leadership. 

How do you figure out what doc work needs to be done, without someone telling you? I recommend setting up biweekly meetings with two groups: product teams that you support, and partner engineering groups (devrel groups) that interact with partners. (The name of this group varies by company &dash; just find whoever interacts with your users, and meet with them regularly.) These two groups will help identify the work for you. 

When working with these product groups, ask for their roadmaps, as this will give you a clear idea about what's coming (rather than being informed at the last minute). With partner engineering groups, look at the incoming tickets to help identify trends and start conversations about the work that needs to be done. 

### Turn off phone/chat notifications

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_distractions.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Younger generations are more plugged into social media than older ones, undoubtedly. With that sense of connection comes a risk of attention fragmentation and constant distraction. My entire [series on smartphones](/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/) dives into this topic in extensive ways. If you can't mute the distractions around you, you'll struggle to enter into modes that allow for sustained focus. Without sustained focus, you'll be unlikely to make much progress against projects.

Here are a few tips. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb (except for family), and try to carry it in your bag more than your pocket. Remove work email from your phone (but not your work calendar). Turn off Slack notifications and other notifications that will pull you out of the moment. Consider using the Pomodoro technique to set 90 minute sessions of focused work. Experiment with ways to focus that will make you productive. The people around you don't need immediate responses.

### Give reviewers time to read the doc in review meetings

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/advice_doc_reviews.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You'll need input from reviewers (engineers, product managers, partner engineers, and other stakeholders) on the documentation you're writing to bring it up to production quality. When you schedule time with reviewers, shorten the content for review to about 6 pages and allow the reviewer to read it at the start of the meeting, taking the first 20 minutes or so to read the material. 

Most of the time, reviewers prefer to comment as they read. I tell them to vocalize their feedback as I take notes. This allows them to make much faster progress through the document. This review technique is one I learned while at Amazon. See [Matching documentation review practices to company culture](/blog/matching-doc-review-practices-to-company-culture/) for more details. It works and ensures that people will actually review the content, allow you to achieve deadlines and other release timelines for your content.

This approach might seem awkward or odd at first, and it can feel like you're babysitting someone through tasks that they can clearly do on their own. But in my experience, few people read docs outside of review meetings. If they do, their reading is usually cursory. If you have multiple reviewers in the same meeting, it's almost guaranteed that some will have read the material outside the meeting but others won't have read anything. Then you have to either wait for those who haven't read it to read it, frustrating those who have. Or you have to skip the unprepared reviewers from reading and giving feedback. In short, it's just much easier to give everyone time to read the material during the review meeting.

### Find interest through specialization
