## Luddite teens

The _New York Times_ recently published an article titled "Luddite Teens Don't Want Your Likes" (Vadukul), which brought back nostalgic memories for me of the six weeks I spent without a smartphone. The article begins:

> On a brisk recent Sunday, a band of teenagers met on the steps of Central Library on Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn to start the weekly meeting of the Luddite Club, a high school group that promotes a lifestyle of self-liberation from social media and technology. As the dozen teens headed into Prospect Park, they hid away their iPhones—or, in the case of the most devout members, their flip phones, which some had decorated with stickers and nail polish.
> 
> ... [One club member comments:] When I got my flip phone, things instantly changed .... I started using my brain. It made me observe myself as a person. I've been trying to write a book, too. It's like 12 pages now.

As I read the article, I began to trace back in my mind why I returned to using my smartphone and if I should go back to living without it. The club founder, Logan Lane, explains how Instagram made her feel bad about herself, so she first deleted the app, then put her phone in a box. With her phone locked away, life opened up all around her:

> For the first time, she experienced life in the city as a teenager without an iPhone. She borrowed novels from the library and read them alone in the park. She started admiring graffiti when she rode the subway, then fell in with some teens who taught her how to spray-paint in a freight train yard in Queens. And she began waking up without an alarm clock at 7 a.m., no longer falling asleep to the glow of her phone at midnight. Once, as she later wrote in a text titled the "Luddite Manifesto," she fantasized about tossing her iPhone into the Gowanus Canal.

In my experience, when you remove smartphones from your life, you start reading more. Seeing these teens explore and handle books (almost as if discovering them for the first time) matches my experience.</figcaption></figure>

I, too, fantasized about throwing my smartphone into a canal. And I did give my smartphone up for six weeks, but then returned. Reading this article, I started to think back on my journey. What happened? Why did I revert?

I've already recounted the story of returning to my smartphone in "Six weeks in—returning to smartphone (but not as before)." In my experience, the killer app of smartphones is not an app at all—it's the full-screen keyboard, which allows you to text. Without the ability to text, I couldn't communicate much with my wife and other family members. Email is pre-Jurassic, and frequently ignored. Without text, you can still talk on the phone, but phone conversations and voicemail are much less convenient, especially for quick notes to family members.

Texting can be a double-edged sword, though. On the one hand, it allows us to communicate quickly and easily through a screen-based keyboard. On the other, the same screen that enables this easy communication gives us access to app interfaces and the vast amount of information on the Internet, all in the palm of our hand.

Another factor that contributed to my decision to return to using a smartphone was reading Kevin Kelly's _What Technology Wants_. Kelly convinced me that the constant introduction of new technologies is inevitable and that actively rejecting them is akin to adopting the mindset of Ted Kaczynski.

I realized that I needed to find ways to make peace with technology and use it in a way that worked in my favor. So I switched back to smartphones with modified rules. My modified rules worked well initially. But as I became more curious to pinpoint the precise element related to smartphones that pulled my attention away from books, I added previously abandoned sites and practices back.

It wasn't long before I once again found myself checking sites on my smartphone frequently, even without apps. Even without apps, you can read most content just as easily from a web browser. Responsive design has gotten that good.

I also started checking both personal and work email on my phone. I found myself once again looking at email at any spare moment of my day—waiting in line for coffee, waiting for the elevator, in the bathroom, on the train, and so on. I felt bad about this, especially because I don't even receive that many email messages. Yet I had already relearned to check my email and news every twenty minutes.

I also started backsliding against my 90-minute pomodoros, which had been the key to unlocking so much productivity. I told myself that I no longer needed them, that my focus on a task was fine even with small interruptions to check email, news, or more.

All the while, I started reading less and feeling more superficial, getting less done. What happened? Had I let the smartphone control my life again?

I avoided bringing my phone into my bedroom at night, but I would bring my laptop instead and get hooked on some mindless TV show. Or I'd wake up early, such as 4:30 am, and reach for my laptop (conveniently located under the bed) to continue the show. After all, what else can you do at 4:30 am when you can't sleep?

I felt like a former alcoholic who had fallen off the wagon. I underestimated the insidiousness of the smartphone and Internet. I tried to remove both Chrome and Gmail but found that I couldn't remove these apps, only disable them, so I did. I assumed that re-enabling them wouldn't be that hard, but I did manage to resist doing so. 

Disabling these apps (Gmail and Chrome, specifically) made my smartphone more of a paperweight. Without these apps, the smartphone became useful only for a small number of functions. I deliberated about switching to the Light Phone but remembered that with the Kyocera, I spent a lot of time figuring out hacky workarounds (such as using srccpy, "screen copy," to digitally mirror the phone on my computer so that I could text my wife).

Reading articles like [I'm Gen Z, and I ditched my iPhone for the Light Phone II for a week](https://mashable.com/review/light-phone-two) reminded me of the cumbersome workarounds that come with abandoning a smartphone, which you realize little by little. The initial rush of abandoning these technologies is quickly replaced by the inability to perform basic tasks. For example, want to listen to Audible, check the weather, rent a Lime scooter, create a hotspot, join a Zoom meeting during your commute, view your work calendar, or find an unfamiliar address? The amount of time spent trying to replicate the convenient aspects of a smartphone can make it feel like the basic phone is more of a hindrance than a help.

I also remembered how easy it was to replace my smartphone with another form of distraction: streaming media. Without some willpower to resist distraction (whether in the form of smartphones, TV shows, sports, or other), trying to abandon my smartphone for a basic phone was a losing battle. I could simply substitute the smartphone's distraction with something else, and did. So the Light Phone probably wouldn't solve my problems, I reasoned.

At any rate, finding the right balance (whether using a basic phone, smartphone, or some stripped-down middle-ground) was a learning process. After disabling Chrome and Gmail, I did stop checking my email so frequently—and more importantly, I stopped thinking about my email. One morning I woke up, walked down the stairs to my computer, and worked on a post for an hour without thinking to check email. (Normally it was the first thing I checked upon waking.)

I also started doubling down on my bedroom technology use: no more bringing my laptop or smartphone to my bed, which only prompted me to watch streaming media until I fell asleep (or to watch it if I woke up early). Instead, I brought in a book. Reading it for 30 minutes put my mind into a slumber.

The more I read, the more progress I made in books. And that progress gave me more momentum to keep reading. It didn't take long before I found myself once more thinking about the ideas in the book more than a TV show or email. (Our brain really is plastic and can easily be reshaped.)

In trying to restore the balance of technology use, I didn't realize how delicate my rules were. Simply having the ability to check email and news on my phone seemed enough to imprison me again (was it the Dopamine hit during a time of boredom?). Removing those apps lifted the burden and prompted me to do more reading. My smartphone mostly sat on my desk, like an ominous Pandora's box. Without the apps, I had neutered it.

Without many of the information-delivering apps, it seems to be inert.</figcaption></figure>

I did find myself looking at my smartphone now and then and wondering what the device was for. It was obviously underperforming its capability, like having a Lamborghini that you used only to drive to the mailbox and back. But just as with any sports car, could you really drive it without occasionally accelerating well past the speed limit?

## Did I achieve the end goal of the experiment?

I related the above only to be realistic and honest about my relationship with the smartphone and technology. It's not as if one can easily walk away, form a Luddite club, and get immersed in the classics for ever more. Life is more complicated, especially if one works in tech and has family and friends with smartphones. The only feasible path, in my experience, is to find a way to neutralize the addictive elements of the smartphone.

For me, this meant disabling email and news mechanisms. (Almost no one is addicted to checking the weather on their phones, or setting alarms all day.) I've never been much of an Instagram or Facebook user, and Twitter lost its appeal long before Elon Musk took over. Each person has their own kryptonite, so what might be Instagram for one person (like Logan Lane in the Luddite Club) could be a news or email app for another. (My kids checked their email once a week, if that.) By neutralizing my phone, I figuratively moved away from it while still interacting and participating in modern life and maintaining social relationships.

## Overall achievements

Despite the ups and downs of my experiment in moving away from smartphones, I achieved and learned so much through this series. In this final section, I'll wrap it up and form a conclusion about it all.

In "My initial rules and reasons for intentional smartphone use," I listed these goals for my experiment:

> What do I hope to achieve by removing smartphones?
> 
> * Long-form attention to read a book without my mind wandering
> * Sleep through the night without randomly waking early
> * Have more mental energy in the evenings
> * Get into periods of flow and become more productive at work
> * Have more peace of mind
> * Have more realizations from reflection
> * Be more present with other people

Definitely, both literally and figuratively abandoning my smartphone has achieved every one of these goals. I won't go through each one in detail, but overall, it's a resounding yes. Instead of commenting on each of these high-level goals, I'll call out more concrete highlights from the series.

## Productivity

Of all the techniques for productivity, the 90-minute focus sessions worked the best for me. I'm still amazed by how much I can accomplish in 90 minutes when I focus on a task, not being pulled away into anything else. I even sometimes measure out work by the number of 90-minute focus sessions I think the task will take.

Although it can be hard to focus for that long, I'm in love with the productivity outcomes, the ability to knock out a big documentation project seemingly in an afternoon, or to write a lengthy article in a single session. The productivity method makes me think I can accomplish nearly any amount of work.

The technique has some tradeoffs, such as ignoring the world around me for a bit. But if I wait to check email and other sites between focus sessions only, the method works. Ninety minutes is enough to get some serious velocity going. The only drawback is that if I only have 30 minutes of time until a meeting, I sometimes feel that starting a focus session isn't worthwhile.


## Reading

Reading! If there's one major reward for neutralizing my smartphone, it's the return to reading. I don't remember reading so many books in my life, not since college. The smartphones and Internet have prompted a gradual, incremental transition from reading print to online media. At some point during the past 20 years, books became something I stopped consuming (except for audiobooks while commuting).

In returning to books, I realized that I love reading. A good book can change your perspective in transformational ways. Reading feels enriching, soothes my brain waves, helps me understand topics at deeper levels, and makes me more informed, especially when I write.

I've learned that for me, print books are superior to anything on a screen. This might be due partly to my declining eyesight. (I now carry two sets of glasses—one for driving, one for computers.) But I also like annotating books with a pen as I read. It makes me feel like an active reader. I've grown accustomed to reading each morning while sipping a caramel latte (my espresso favorite).

At work, I've been running a book club focused on the automotive and transportation industry. I'm also reading long documents at my work (whether product requirements, engineering designs, or other documents that others usually just glance at). Yes, I print them out and had a stapler at my desk. One day, a neighboring engineer heard the sound of a stapler and perked up, noting that he hadn't heard the sound of a stapler for years.


## Writing

I learned that writing is a conversation with the texts you're reading. Previously, I approached writing primarily by following a technique of asking 20 questions about the topic and trying to answer them—going through this round of questioning multiple times. While this brainstorming technique still worked, it wasn't as powerful as finding a relevant author to read and then summarizing, commenting, and building off of those ideas. Writing is a conversation you were having with other authors.

Writing is also an experience in living. In my view, it makes little sense to explore a topic that doesn't matter deeply to me, and which doesn't involve incorporating any changes into my life. In the books I read, I liked to see the author personally invested, trying things out, experimenting with changes. Although essays were good reads, when the author injected personal experience and brought me on a personal quest (like Johann Hari did in _Stolen Focus_), it made the writing much more engaging.

This approach of balancing ideas with personal experience was perhaps the only way to compensate for the lack of deep scholarly expertise about topics. I might not know every study that's been done to prove or disprove what effects smartphones have on us, but when I brought my own life experiments to the table, this sense of active living and experimenting seemed to add authenticity and intrigue to the content, which perhaps compensated for lack of expertise.

On a more practical level, I also realized one technique that worked well for documentation projects: alternating modes between reading and writing. I often devote one focus session to reading and gathering nuggets of information, especially in areas where it was thin. Then I devote the next focus session to smoothing out and integrating the information. This switching back and forth between reading and writing makes creating documentation a lot easier. As a result, I can more easily sustain the 90-minute focus sessions and go about writing projects more effortlessly.

## Television

During this series, I realized that streaming media (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) can take the place of a smartphone. Although we've all heard the advice of not taking devices into the bedroom (to promote good sleep hygiene), I had previously ignored that advice. I learned that the advice should be followed. The more I propped my laptop on my chest as I reclined on my bed, the fewer books I read, and the later I stayed up. Staying up later meant getting worse sleep the next morning, which then led to more caffeine and more distractibility. At one point I even got "caffeinism" (and learned to limit my lattes to just two per day).

Watching TV in the family room (rather than on a personal laptop in bed) also promoted TV as a social experience with family members. The TV brought us together on the couch as we commented and interacted about the show. Even a bad TV show could be fun to watch with the right people. For example, I recently watched "Business Proposal," a Korean drama, with one of my daughters who wants to be an exchange student in Japan, and it was fun to see her excitement and point of view about the content. If I watched the show alone, I wouldn't have found it nearly as interesting.

I also replaced the phone-as-alarm-clock model in my bedroom. I loved the old-school 1980s GE alarm clock I purchased (which you can now only buy on eBay). The idea of putting a screen-based digital assistant (Alexa Show or similar) on my nightstand seemed counterintuitive to a device-free bedroom. I like looking at the red numbers on my old-school alarm clock, its only real function is to make an alarm sound (or play bad FM radio). The old-school alarm clock is a constant reminder of my childhood and the days before the Internet.


## Wayfinding

Wayfinding also proved to be a breakthrough for me this year. As I learned to navigate without any GPS navigation apps (at least around my home city), I figured out where things are located! I know it sounds trivial, but it felt so good to be fully focused and immersed on the road rather than subject to the micro directions of my smartphone's robot voice. I learned (more or less) the logic of avenues versus streets, the numbering schemes, and the main connecting roads and highways. Having a mental map of the roads helped me feel more comfortable and certain as I drove.

I still use my phone for podcasts and music, but I try to avoid using GPS as much as I can, recognizing that if I navigate on my own, the route sticks in my mind much better. For trips outside of my home area, or emergencies or other spontaneous needs, or if I simply get lost, I open up the app, but not if I can help it.

I thought I would navigate via paper maps (and bought a handful), but not really. I usually just study the route ahead of time on Google Maps on my laptop and sometimes make a few notes on paper.

For 20 years of marriage, my wife has made fun of my navigational impairment. Not so much anymore! Sometimes I raise an eyebrow when I see her type in a direction on her map that I know how to get to.

Did the navigational certitude give way to increased memory for episodic events? I didn't have too many moments of brain fog, but I never tried to measure my memory skills. Given how much time we spend driving, though, making the switch away from GPS navigation apps proved more fulfilling than I initially thought. It was an easy way to push back against automation with the machine, to get my brain's wayfinding gears turning.

## Cyber skepticism

With my experiment, I also realized that I was more of a cyberskeptic than I realized. Throughout my 20-year career in tech, I had always been excited to work on the frontiers of tech, seeing new technologies and applications as the next step forward. I was always a gadget/device person, someone who esteemed innovation and who frequently geeked out with some new website approach (for example, Docs as Code).

During my experiment, my enthusiasm for tech waned a bit. I started to realize that I longed to revert to a world before smartphones. I didn't become a hardcore cyberskeptic (for example, I still can't stomach Zuboff's _Surveillance Capitalism_, and I kind of don't mind being tracked), but I'm long past the idea that all tech is beneficial. So much of social media can be toxic, proliferating the amount of extremism, disinformation, and division. It can lead to wacky conspiracy theorists (Q, R) attracting an astounding number of followers, and family members can become divided by "red" vs. "blue" teams. The list could go on.

I'm exactly sure how much of a cyberskeptic I'll become. I no longer foresee purchasing any more digital assistants. The overall internet is still wonderful, in my view. It has given me a space to write and publish, and an audience. It also opened up infinite resources for knowledge consumption. Many other technologies (including Google Maps, which I explored all the time on my computer) have opened up new possibilities to explore the spaces around me. But more and more, I'm learning to be more discerning about which technology to adopt and how to incorporate it.

Years earlier, tech seemed so innocent, so benign. Earlier in my career, I had adopted more of a "Whig mentality of history," as Krinnock and Hoff say (in _May I Ask a Technical Question_), which is to assume all technological innovation leads to progress. Not so anymore. The way smartphones suck everyone's attention at any spare moment is startling. If someone had been transported from the 1980s to the present and observed how ubiquitous and attention-demanding smartphones were, they would be shocked. (Incrementalism obscured the social changes.)

{% include ads.html %}

As a partial cyberskeptic, I sometimes wonder about the value of the documentation I produce at work. Would the world be better off _without_ the work I do today? I sometimes wonder. I'd never asked that before. One passage in Johann Hari's _Stolen Focus_ book especially haunted me:

> One day, James Williams—the former Google strategist I met—addressed an audience of hundreds of leading tech designers and asked them a simple question: "How many of you want to live in the world you are designing?" There was a silence in the room. People looked around them. Nobody put up their hand.

In conversations with my kids, they likewise fantasize about living during a time before the internet. Me too. But then we watch a show filmed in the 80s or early 90s, and that nostalgia fades.

Despite the cognitive dissonance of working for big tech, I also marvel to see what new wonders technology might introduce, such as with generative AI. In reading _May I Ask a Technical Question?_ which has a heavy cyber-skeptic bias, I realized that I'm not fully in the cyberskeptic camp. I'm more in the middle ground between cyberskeptic and cyber-optimist, which gives me a great vantage point as a writer.

## Camera

I haven't written much about using a regular camera instead of my smartphone camera. Part of my plan when I initially abandoned my smartphone was to figure out how to take pictures without a real camera. Although I experimented briefly with a compact point-and-shoot, I ended up returning it.

However, during the year I volunteered as a team photographer for my daughter's soccer club. I dusted off an old Nikon D60 DSLR, bought a zoom lens, learned a bit about shutter speeds and aperture, and started taking action photos at almost every soccer game. It was a lot of fun, actually.

In doing sports photography, which almost invariably requires a zoom lens, I had to relearn some photography skills that have been latent since my days as a yearbook photographer during high school (back in 1993!). I sometimes think that I should take up photography as a hobby more actively. But honestly, for stills that don't involve zooming, smartphone cameras are comparable if not better. I love taking pictures of an area that I explore and then posting them as reviews on Google Maps.

## News

I still struggle with the news. Ever since reading Rolf Dobelli's _Stop Reading the News_, I've been much more aware of the negativity bias of news. Another problem is that reading the news pulls me online, and once online, invites me to click elsewhere, making news more of a "gateway drug." But when I stopped reading the news, I felt disconnected from global events, curious to know what was going on. So I started glancing through the _New York Times _summaries.

The problem with this approach (occasionally glancing through daily news summaries) is that I didn't want play-by-play summaries of breaking news but rather more general summaries of what's going on at a higher level, which I can consume at a less regular cadence. I also want to read it offline. I once experimented with a print subscription to the _New York Times _but then realized that I didn't want to feel compelled to read a massive paper every day. Each newspaper has nearly a book's worth of information and can take at least an hour to get through (skimming).

Recently I decided to get a print subscription to _The Week_, hoping it will be a way of batching my news reading to a lazy weekend hour. I'm not looking for in-depth reporting to explore all sides of an issue; I mostly want the high-level gist of what's going on, preferably batched into a weekly publication, and easily digestible. And I hope that reading offline will make me less prone to wandering online. As I said, it's an ongoing experiment.

## Revisiting my rules

In this series, I listed various technology rules that I would follow, which is what Cal Newport recommends. The technology rules we make for ourselves might require constant refinement until we get to the right mix of technology use. I started out with a strict set of initial rules only to modify them a bit later on. Below, I'll provide yet another iteration.

Remember that what might work for one person might not make sense for another. My rules fit me, based on those apps that are _my_ kryptonite, based on my social needs with my family, and my work. Here are my latest rules:

1. Using a smartphone (instead of a basic phone) is all right as long as the distracting elements are neutralized (for example, remove Chrome, Gmail, News apps, etc.).
2. Don't take smartphones or laptops into bed (to view streaming media). Take a book instead.
3. Try to keep the phone in Do Not Disturb mode—disable app notifications and phone calls except for family and calendar apps. Same with email and chat notifications—mute them.
4. Get your primary news offline rather than online.
5. Keep your email inbox light by unsubscribing to almost everything.
6. Don't rely on mapping applications when driving if you can help it. Learn the logic of the streets. (GPS can help, however, if you're actively learning and exploring new areas.)
7. Avoid using social media as entertainment. You can check it every so often to gather information, but generally, it's not worthwhile.
8. Leverage the smartphone as a utilitarian device, not as an infotainment device. It can be extremely helpful at times (like when renting an e-scooter or processing a Covid test).
9. Approach tasks in 90-minute pomodoros. During the 90 minutes, don't get pulled into distractions (such as email or news).
10. To switch into TPN mode, do the task for 5 minutes. Then alternate back and forth until your TPN engine is fully warmed up and you no longer need the timer.

The process is an ongoing refinement about what works and what does not, taking the best of what new tech offers and tamping down the bad.

## Recommended reading list

Throughout this series, I've quoted and commented on many of the following books. If you're interested in continuing this theme, I  recommend reading the following:

* _Stolen Focus,_ by Johan Hari
* _Stop Reading the News,_ by Rolf Dobelli
* _Digital Minimalism,_ by Cal Newport
* _Deep Work,_ by Cal Newport
* _Wayfinding,_ by O'Connor, M. R.
