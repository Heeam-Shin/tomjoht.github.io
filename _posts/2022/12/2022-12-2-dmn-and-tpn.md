## Context recap in this series

In a recent post in this series, [How to move from focus sessions to flow sessions](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/from-focus-sessions-to-flow/), I summarized Csikszentmihalyi’s book on flow and explored how to enter this state. However, I was dissatisfied about the assumptions Csikszentmihalyi makes about “psychic entropy” being the natural state of the mind, and I wanted to understand why it was so. Psychic entropy (Csikszentmihalyi’s term) is more commonly referred to as “monkey mind,” and in my post [From monkey mind to calm, ordered consciousness -- even outside of flow? Wrestling with Csikszentmihalyi's assumptions about psychic entropy](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/from-monkey-mind-to-calm-consciousness), I didn’t uncover any special reason for our default monkey mind other than speculating that our random Internet surfing behavior (or similar behavior with surfing TV) might teach the brain similar chaotic patterns to follow. In contrast, reading books seemed to encourage a more linear, sequential and mellow brain waves. 

That consciousness post was kind of in right field, way out of my depth and veering further from more tangible topics. I was about to leave the exploration there and retreat back into more familiar territory when I stumbled onto a book called _ADHD 2.0_ that catapulted my thinking on this topic into more modern science. I learned terms and theories that better articulate this world of the brain when it comes to focused or unfocused states. These areas of the brain include the default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN). Understanding how these two networks interact can be helpful for this larger discussion about staying focused.

## DMN and TPN

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (cameras that can observe the brain in action) has moved forward how we understand the brain. Scientists use fMRI to observe the brain in different states, and found that when the brain isn’t engaged in any particular task, the Default Mode Network (DMN) is active. The DMN was first observed at around 2005 in a paper by X.?? It’s called the Default Mode Network because it’s the default mode of the brain when you’re not engaged in a task. In contrast, when you’re focused on a task, the Task Positive Network (TPN) is active. (By network, this means there are various regions of the brain that light up, rather than one specific spot.)

In _ADHD 2.0_, Edward Hallowell and John Ratey explain the DMN lights up when we’re lost in thought. For example, brooding, ruminating, thinking about future events, dissecting past events, daydreaming, letting our imaginations go free, woolgathering, thinking about worries, going down rabbit holes, and more. When you miss an exit because you’re thinking about what life would be like living on the street after the economy collapses and the Ukraine war escalates into WWIII, that’s your DMN in fully active mode. 

Most of the time, the DMN focuses on negative thoughts. And if you keep replaying negative thoughts over and over (negative rumination), you can get stuck deeper in this mode. Hallowell and Ratey say that when you find yourself in DMN mode, you should take advantage of the DMN’s ability to jump tracks (for example, to go down random rabbit holes) by distracting it. The DMN can easily be distracted, evidenced by its ability to think about one topic one minute, then another the next, and so on. So to exit DMN mode, externalize your thought in some other way. For example, focus on your breathing in and out in specific patterns. Or go find your pet and play with it. Or look at your environment and observe 10 things you never noticed before. Get outside yourself. 

I find the DMN fascinating. It aligns with the psychic entropy that Csikszentmihalyi talked about. Csikszentmihalyi’s big idea about human happiness was for people to focus on tasks (slipping into the TPN mode) so that the DMN wouldn't run wild and fill the mind with worries and negative imagination.

As you shift into specific tasks, the Task Positive Network, or TPN, lights up. For example, suppose you’re fixing your bicycle, or writing code, or reading a book &mdash; in each case, you’re doing a task. When you’re focused on a task, your DMN recedes into the background and isn’t active. With the DMN locked away, you aren’t burdened by the intruding negative thoughts. In Csikszentmihalyi’s’s world, you slip into states of flow and are no longer focused on anxious negative brooding or concerns.

I feel like I now have the right terms to talk about these different functions of the brain. When you’re in monkey mind mode, the DMN is active. When you’re engaged in a task, the TPN is active. In most brains, the DMN and TPN function like a seesaw. When the DMN is active, the TPN is inactive; conversely, when the TPN is active, the DMN is inactive. 

However, here’s where things get interesting. People with ADHD can have both DMN and TPN modes _active at the same time._ There isn’t always a see-saw effect. Further, there can be a “glitchy switch” between the two modes, Hallowell and Ratey say. Someone with ADHD can get stuck in TPN mode, which locks them into a hyper-focused state where everything sort of becomes mute around them. Similarly, they can get stuck in DMN mode, unable to transition into specific tasks. Or with both modes co-active, as soon as they start a task, the DMN distracts them away from the task, pulling their attention elsewhere. The inability to shut off the DMN when you’re focused on a task can make it nearly impossible to focus on the task, as the mind wanders elsewhere and is pulled away by the smallest of curiosities.


## Switching from DMN to TPN

Learning about these networks in _ADHD 2.0_ was super interesting to me. First of all, three of the four people I live with have ADHD; learning about the traits has brought me greater understanding, compassion, and tolerance than ever before. (I’ve only scratched the iceberg here on ADHD traits, by the way.) And second, I’m wondering if the key to jumping into more productive, flow-like states is to learn how to transition from the DMN into the TPN.

I personally have a hard time “getting going.” In the morning, I often flitter around a bit, doing easy tasks, before I can get in the rhythm and groove of work. If I can figure out ways to quiet the DMN, or even just to warm up my TPN network, I will have solved a huge obstacle to productivity. 

I’ve written a lot about the value of focus sessions and turning off distractions. But what I never found in previous books (such as those by Cal Newport) were tried-and-true techniques for sustaining motivation and getting into the TPN mode early. It’s common to procrastinate on difficult tasks, doing almost anything but what we should until deadlines and stress to complete the tasks takes over. How can we get the TPN engine going? 

Let’s take a concrete example: writing this post. I finished _ADHD 2.0_ a few days ago and wanted to write a post about it, but I had trouble starting. So to this post, I tried a simple technique. I started watching 10 minutes of sports. Then I set a timer and told myself I’d work on this post for just 5 minutes. I can do anything for 5 minutes, right? Then I set the timer to watch another 5 minutes of sports. After that, I set my writing timer for 10 minutes. Then back to sports for 5 minutes. Then at this point, I sort of caught a rhythm in writing this post and have lost track of my timer. I think I’ve been writing for 30 minutes now. 

I haven’t read this TPN warm-up technique suggested anyway, but it probably is just a spinoff of the Pomodoro technique or an implementation of the saying “The first step is always the hardest.” Just as you don’t start playing full-on competition soccer without warming up first, why not treat the brain in a similar way? Do some light warmups to get going. 

Besides the TPN warm-up, what else works? I asked my colleague the other week what catalysts she uses to get into tasks. She said she finds some aspect of the task that she likes and wants to do, and uses that aspect as a way to get into the task. For example, maybe this documentation task will allow you to learn about something you’ve wanted to know. So you start learning about that thing you wanted to learn, and then gradually merge your attention into the task. 

The ability to activate the TPN seems like one of the keys to unlock productivity. If I can sustain my energy toward my goals, I’d be unstoppable. I usually get derailed when I lose motivation or interest in the task.


## VAST

An interesting aspect of _ADHD 2.0_ is the introduction of the term VAST. Hallowell and Ratey published _[Driven to Distraction](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention/dp/0307743152)_ in 1994. In that book, they raised awareness and understanding of ADHD (which was first observed in 1902). In _ADHD 2.0_, the authors assess what’s changed over the last 30 years in the field and catch up on the topic. Among the list of what’s new is something they call “variable attention stimulus trait” (VAST), which is brought on by the modern condition. When people describe their behavior as “so ADD” or describe themselves as having short attention spans but don’t have diagnosed ADHD, Hallowell and Ratey call this VAST. The authors write: 

> Beyond the sources of biologically based ADHD, there are a lot of people who act as if they have ADHD but on close inspection turn out not to have the diagnosable condition. These are the people who have ADHD-like symptoms caused by the conditions of modern life. Their “ADHD” is a response to the massive increase in stimuli that now bombard our brains and

our world.

The massive behavioral conditioning we’ve all been undergoing since the advent of ubiquitous electronic communications technology has changed us radically. But this dramatic, if not epochal, change is underappreciated. It’s underappreciated because we’re living in it as it happens, like frogs in cold water that slowly gets heated up without the frogs trying to jump out, until they’re boiled. Our world has been getting heated up big-time. And while we could jump out, it’s pretty difficult to do so and still function in the modern world. Most of us can go no more than a few seconds without looking for a screen.

> Modern life compels these changes by forcing our brains to process exponentially more data points than ever before in human history, dramatically more than we did prior to the era of the Internet, smartphones, and social media. The hardwiring of our brains has not changed—as far as we know, although some experts do suspect that our hardwiring is changing—but in our efforts to adapt to the speeding up of life and the projectile spewing of data splattering onto our brains all the time, we’ve had to develop new, often rather antisocial habits in order to cope. These habits have come together to create something we now call VAST: the variable attention stimulus trait. (14-15)

In other words, modern life has amplified the amount of information we consume daily, changing our brain’s processors so they must handle more and more information in less time. If you recall my initial post in this series ([My awakening moment about how smartphones fragment our attention span](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/)), one writer said he became so addicted to reading the news that he started experiencing anxiety due to the massive amounts of information. Rolf Dobelli explains:

> Yet I still felt inexorably drawn to the overwhelming, garish parade of news, even though it was clearly making me anxious. Fragments of news reports were constantly intruding into my reality, and I was suddenly finding it difficult to read longer texts in one go. It was as though somebody had carved up my attention into tiny pieces. I started to panic that I’d never be able to recover my attention span, that I’d never again be able to assemble these fragments into a whole. (p 10)

In my earlier experiments to reclaim my attention, I went through a period where, following Dobelli’s advice, I also stopped reading the news (as well as social media). I didn’t realize how news had been affecting me, but yes, I sure noticed a difference. There was a lot less information my brain had to process, and this cleared up more space for reading books. I soon rediscovered reading and how enjoyable books can be. 

I’ve since returned to reading news, but I’ve never been a heavy news reader. I glance through the summaries of the New York Times several times a day, at most. I’ve also returned to glancing at Twitter (impossible not to curiously peek at what’s going on lately). But strangely,  two activities (small as they are) seem to provide me with enough information that I no longer feel drawn to read books. It’s weird. I don’t consider my online intake of information to be that extensive, yet I can unequivocally say that the more time I spend online, the less time I spend reading books. The online experience is a constant barrage of information coming at me, and maybe the brain just wasn’t meant to process that much, or maybe the stimulation from all that information deters any interest in further information consumption. I don’t know. I thought I might give news up entirely, but I felt disconnected and out of the loop of world events. I never figured out a good strategy for staying connected without becoming overloaded.

What doesn’t quite make sense to me is this line from the above passage from Hallowell and Ratey: “Modern life compels these changes by forcing our brains to process exponentially more data points than ever before in human history.” Am I consuming more information by browsing online than I consume when reading a book? What is it about the Internet’s information delivery that wreaks so much havoc on our brains? Nonlinearity? Disjointedness? Fragmentation and chaos? Critics are quick to point the blame on social media, but Hallowell and Ratey group all of this under a larger umbrella of “modern life.”


## Coming back to TPN

So can this modern condition be fixed? For those with VAST, can we return our brains to a pre-VAST state? For those with ADHD, what hacks can be employed to switch from the DMN into the TPN, and to fix the “glitchy switch”?

Hallowell and Ratey champion the idea that the brain is malleable. Neuroplasticity is another modern finding of the brain, they say. The brain can change; it isn’t fixed. Interestingly, the authors say that strengthening your balance can help your focus. Another part of the brain, the cerebellum, has an interesting connection with balance such that strengthening your balance also strengthens your cerebellum, which then helps address some ADHD issues. Hallowell relates a touching story about helping a boy in China overcome ADHD by doing things as simple as putting on socks while standing one leg at a time, juggling, and doing other balance exercises (in addition to a lot of hugs for Oxytocin). [Zing Performance](https://www.zingperformance.com/) is all about addressing ADHD through balance (though some think it’s a scam).

While reading this section on balance, I almost bought a balance board but then thought better and got two skateboards instead – one for me and one for my daughter. I figured skateboarding would be more interesting and would teach balance in a more fun way. Well, the weather has been rainy (and now snowy) in Washington, but in our initial foray on the skateboards, we went down a small hill and my daughter crashed pretty hard. She hasn’t taken the skateboard out since then. Even with this setback, I’m determined to incorporate the skateboard (a longboard) into a leg of my commute, so we’ll see if that works. Then we can have another go at skateboarding together. (I have a parallel agenda of fixing my atrophied right calf through skateboarding as well, but that’s another story.)


## Exercise 

Hallowell and Ratey say other powerful non-medicinal factors for addressing ADHD include exercise, sleep, and nutrition. There are no surprises here – these factors seem to influence a lot of things. But for people with ADHD, getting exercise can help strengthen connective tissues in the brain. My wife’s daily hike has a noticeably uplifting effect on her. She always comes back in a GREAT mood, so I encourage her to go hiking as much as she can. My youngest daughter plays club soccer, and the exercise she gets is rejuvenating as well. I’m not sure that exercise has that strong of an effect on my psyche, but who doesn’t feel better after some exercise?

Hallowell and Ratey even recount a story of a high-achieving professional who had to cease running due to a knee injury and found his ADHD symptoms (which he didn’t know he had) started to surface and dismantle his life. A doctor prescribed him Ritalin to address the issue temporarily, and when his knee healed he dropped the Ritalin and just started running again. The issue was fixed.


## Unwrapping gifts

The authors never reveal a secret trick to fixing ADHD. Instead, the overall message of the book is for people with ADHD to learn to “unwrap their gifts.” There are positive upsides to every negative trait with ADHD. ADHD provides “a complex set of contradictory or paradoxical tendencies,” the authors write (7). For example, people with ADHD often have a positive energy and charisma, a playfulness and spontaneity that draws people to them. The DMN might lead to worry but can also facilitate empathy. Many ADHD people are better at taking risks and often excel as entrepreneurs and in the financial markets. Some are good at processing chaotic situations with lots of incoming data, with the ability to remain calm under pressure, and so on.

Medication has also come a long way in the past 30 years, as well as general ADHD research (ADHD is one of the most researched psychological conditions). The authors try to help reduce the stigma around ADHD, to get rid of the idea that it’s a learning “disorder,” and to instead identify the strengths these traits lead to. Overall, this book is a must-read for anyone with ADHD or who wants to understand family members or friends with ADHD. As an added bonus, it’s only 135 pages and is well written.

In upcoming posts, I want to explore the DMN and TPN modes of the brain more to see what techniques exist for activating these two networks, more specifically, for activating the TPN.
