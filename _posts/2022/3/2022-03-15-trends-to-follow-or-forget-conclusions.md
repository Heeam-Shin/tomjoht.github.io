description: "This post is <a href='/trends/trends-to-follow-or-forget-intro.html'>part of a series on trends</a> that explores trends that I've either followed or forgotten, and why. The overall goal is to better understand the reasons that drive trend adoption or abandonment in my personal career. This is the final post in the series and tries to draw some conclusions about the observations of the previous 15 trends explored."
