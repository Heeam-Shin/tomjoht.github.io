## What is tech comm and marcom?


Tech comm and marcom (marketing communication) refers to using tech comm content with marcom campaigns. The idea is that documentation can be used for more than just product instructions. Documentation can be leveraged as a full-fledged marketing asset. After all, documentation is information rich, keyword dense, and of high value to users. Why not use documentation to help build relationships with customers?

In fact, in [The History of Content According to Sarah O'Keefe](/blog/history-of-content-content-components-podcast/), a Content Components podcast, Sarah says a high number of people (80% for some business domains?) want to view the documentation before buying the product. When customers see the documentation, they get a sense of the complexity of a product, the time for implementation, requirements, and more.

## Why I embraced tech comm and marcom

As someone who writers regularly on a blog, I thought that extending my writing talents into marcom domains would be a logical fit. I could bring my product knowledge to the marcom writing scenarios, and communicate complex concepts with clarity and precision.

Additionally, working in developer docs, I knew that most developers preferred to have more information-rich content anyway, not high-level promises in slick-looking PDFs. Everything pointed to me getting more involved in marcom.

## Why I abandoned tech comm and marcom

Although contemporary marketing theories seem to embrace the development and delivery of helpful, story-rich content of interest to customers (rather than more traditional sales-oriented literature), I've yet to work with a marketing group that actually did this. The marketing groups I worked with rarely ventured beyond highly sanitized, happy-path topics to address actual frictions and issues that might be engaging to customers. Transparency, honesty, and storytelling were practically nonexistent in the marketing materials these groups produced.

Whenever I tried to write anything that addressed an issue or friction, it was cut out so that only the tech how-to remained. Try to drive a blog post with story without mentioning any issues or frictions &mdash; it doesn't work. After a few rounds of this, I grew uninterested in copying/pasting docs into marketing blog systems. Additionally, any docs that I put into marketing blog posts would go out of date and not be maintained after the day it was published.

What about repurposing sections of documentation into larger marketing collateral, such as ebooks? This seems like a better partnership, but when I worked with a marketing group, the ebook writer wrote the content in InDesign (or something similar). She copied chunks of instruction from the documentation here and there, but it quickly went out of date.

The marketing team even adopted Adobe Experience Manager, which has an XML component. I thought this would allow us to re-use documentation in marketing assets, but apparently you could only embed docs in certain regions in templates, and you could only embed marketing content in other regions, not freely mix the two. At any rate, we didn't want to migrate all content to XML and manage it in that system anyway.

## Current status

I think the prevailing trends with marketing are to emphasize content marketing and customer relationships, not to just push sales literature to customers. However, almost all corporate blogs are just PR rooms. Blogs are spaces to make product announcements or to publish release notes. The number of corporate marketers who are captivating audiences with story and other helpful content seem few and far between.
