Although I've listened to Content Components on and off for a while, this latest interview with [Sarah O'Keefe from Scriptorium](https://www.scriptorium.com/) titled the "The History of Content According to Sarah O'Keefe" -- [Part 1](https://heretto.com/project/content-components-podcast/?wchannelid=kahto6p5y5&wmediaid) and [Part 2](https://heretto.com/project/content-components-podcast/?wchannelid=kahto6p5y5&wmediaid) &mdash; was really fun to listen to. I actually listened to it twice. (Each part is only about 15 min. long.)

[Part 1](https://heretto.com/project/content-components-podcast/?wchannelid=kahto6p5y5&wmediaid) explores the idea of content re-use, starting with the revolution of movable type (which allowed letters used for printing to be reused with new content) to the challenges of reusing content between documentation and elearning. Many elearning folks are persuaded that "bouncy PowerPoint" (slides with custom animations and dynamic effects) helps people learn better than plain content (which is repurposed from documentation). Others argue that bouncy PowerPoint is a waste of time and that plain content is more accurate and on-target for learning.

[Part 2](https://heretto.com/project/content-components-podcast/?wchannelid=kahto6p5y5&wmediaid) explores why [Thomas Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions) was the most helpful book in Sarah's college education. Sarah says Kuhn says that it takes a while for people to shift paradigms, but once some do, it opens the floodgates to more widespread paradigm shifts. The shift transitions from a small trickle for some time to a massive stream all at once (or something.)

I remember reading Kuhn's book eons ago and liking it, though I couldn't remember the details. It is much more enjoyable than reading Kant (who is nearly unreadable &mdash; there's some playful confusion between Kuhn and Kant on the podcast). Sarah says Kuhn's book helped explain some of the initial reluctance she faces in helping tech comm companies embrace structured authoring. It takes a while, initially, and then when they do start to paradigm shift, everyone seems to get onboard in a more enthusiastic way.

She says that companies with a lot of risk (e.g., NASA or pharmaceutical industries) are much more risk-averse than companies with little risk (e.g., gaming companies) for failure. Patrick finds this idea to be "profound." And it makes sense &mdash; if you have a lot to lose, you'll probably be hesitant to make changes. Whereas if you have nothing to lose, you'll much more embracing of risk.

One reason I liked these episodes is because there was finally some disagreement on these podcasts. Don't get me wrong &mdash; I appreciate [Content Components](https://heretto.com/project/content-components-podcast) and Scriptorium's [The Content Strategy Experts](https://www.scriptorium.com/category/podcast/) podcasts. They're full of good information. But they often aren't engaging listens because they lack a sense of debate. They agree too much with each other. For once, especially in Part 1 of the History of Content, we saw two tech comm powerplayers spar off on each other! It was exhilerating.
