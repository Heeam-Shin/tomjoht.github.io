In this episode, we chat about the [API documentation checklist](/learnapidoc/docapis_quality_checklist.html) I created in my [API documentation course](/learnapidoc/). While discussing criteria for [measuring documentation quality](/learnapidoc/docapis_measuring_impact.html), we also chatted about the [Developer Portal Awards from Pronovix](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021). This year I served as a juror for the [API reference](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021#apiref), [onboarding](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021#onboarding), [internal portals](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021#internal), [developer dashboard](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021#dashboard), and [editorial experience](https://pronovix.com/blog/best-developer-portals-2021#editorial) categories -- alongside [Ellis Pratt](https://twitter.com/ellispratt), [Bob Watson](https://twitter.com/bobwatsonphd), and [Lukas Rosenstock](https://twitter.com/LukasRosenstock).

By the way, you can see some jury commentary about what makes for winning developer portals [in a Pronovix video interview here](https://pronovix.com/blog/what-goes-award-winning-developer-portal-2021). (My comments appear about 24 minutes into this video.)

We also chat about other topics in this Let's Talk Docs podcast, such as writing philosophies, community engagement, and [life stories](/blog/life-story-what-shapes-your-lifes-trajectory/), but the focus on measuring API documentation quality probably has the most emphasis.
