  description: >
    This series started with the realization that smartphones were fragmenting my attention span, so I abandoned my smartphone for six weeks. During that time, I rediscovered books and reading. I did return to my smartphone because disconnecting from it also meant disconnecting from family communication, but I continued reading and making more space in my life to consume more of the content offline, rather than the social media feeds on my smartphone.

  description: > 
    In giving up my smartphone, I had to relearn how to navigate. This led to a major realization: I liked driving without having to pay attention to the micro-directions of my smartphone. I felt a sense of autonomy, control, and liberation.

  section: three
  description: > 
    As I sought to regain my attention, I explored ideas about deep focus, and attempted to concentrate for extended periods of time on single tasks. As these focus sessions were grueling, I looked into ideas of flow and other natural techniques to make it more effortless.

    Despite my attempts to ditch my smartphone, I felt a constant pull drawing me back to my smartphone and the constant stream of tech news. This constant push and pull is one that I feel requires artful balance and judgement to navigate.
