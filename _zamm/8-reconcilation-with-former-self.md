Over the Thanksgiving break, I decided to dig out my writing journal, which covered the time of my motorcycle trip, and find some good pictures to post. As I started rereading through my entries, I realized a few things that troubled me. I didn't entirely like the person I was reading. This disturbed me because in my mind, I had remembered someone entirely different. Yet there on the page, every so often an image of someone emerged that bothered me.

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has some insightful passages about this.

I should talk now about Phædrus' knife. It'll help understand some of the
things we talked about.
The application of this knife, the division of the world into parts and the
building of this structure, is something everybody does. All the time we are
aware of millions of things around us...these changing shapes, these burning
hills, the sound of the engine, the feel of the throttle, each rock and weed
and fence post and piece of debris beside the road...aware of these things
but not really conscious of them unless there is something unusual or unless
they reflect something we are predisposed to see. We could not possibly be
conscious of these things and remember all of them because our mind
would be so full of useless details we would be unable to think. From all this
awareness we must select, and what we select and call consciousness is never
the same as the awareness because the process of selection mutates it. We
take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us
and call that handful of sand the world.
Once we have the handful of sand, the world of which we are conscious, a
process of discrimination goes to work on it. This is the knife. We divide the
sand into parts. This and that. Here and there. Black and white. Now and
then. The discrimination is the division of the conscious universe into parts.
The handful of sand looks uniform at first, but the longer we look at it the
more diverse we find it to be. Each grain of sand is different. No two are
alike. Some are similar in one way, some are similar in another way, and we
can form the sand into separate piles on the basis of this similarity and
dissimilarity. Shades of color in different piles...sizes in different piles...grain
shapes in different piles...subtypes of grain shapes in different piles...grades
of opacity in different piles...and so on, and on, and on. You'd think the
process of subdivision and classification would come to an end somewhere,
but it doesn't. It just goes on and on. (82)


There’s a passage in ZAMM where the narrator explains how we select facts to fit our a priori learnings. This explanation appears within a series of chautauquas exploring the origin of what we know, or epistemology. The narrator traces some broad strokes of philosophy about whether our knowledge comes entirely from external input through our senses. The narrator explains the significance of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, which posited that we have an internal, a priori value system that makes sense of the input received through our senses. The narrator explains that we select the facts we choose to see, which fit our a priori value systems. It’s like taking a handful of sand from the beach and calling that selective subset of sand the entire beach. 

[ZAMM quote]

In remembering my motorcycle journey at 17, I had in my head a certain image of myself — young, vibrant, exuberantly charging across the U.S. on a motorcycle, reading ZAMM at night as I camped in my tent in primitive lands. I was on my way to college, full of optimism and agreeableness, and this trip was both formative and revelatory for me.

But as I read my journal entries, I saw a different image start to emerge — a young person who didn’t really understand much of the ZAMM on reading it. I hadn't grasped the larger discussion of classic versus romantic modes of thought, or breaking down dualities between self and other, or what the book was really about. I picked out passages here and there that resonated with me. And as I read through my entries, I started to remember reading ZAMM in my tent at Kilarney Lake, Idaho, and feeling the text was a slog. I should have been enjoying the book more, I thought, I mean heck, when’s a better time to read ZAMM than when you’re on a cross-country motorcycle journey of your own? Why wasn't I enjoying it? But I didn’t slow down, I didn’t look things up (this was pre-Internet), and I suffered through many pages. I remember thinking to myself, why aren't I enjoying this book more? Isn't it about riding motorcycles?

This is understandable, even though ZAMM is frequently assigned in high school curriculums. But what  troubled me more was to see some religious zeal peppered through my thoughts and interpretations. I didn’t grow up Mormon, but I joined the Mormon church as a 16 yr old in high school (2 years before leaving on my motorcycle journey) and was in fact headed to BYU, the mecca for Mormon undergrads. It bothered me to see me defend Mormonism against the idea of Quality as I read the text. 

I know I should be more forgiving of my younger self. I want to believe that I was an open-minded, deep thinker, when in reality I was probably a stubborn kid, recently converted to Mormonism, bent more on adventure and thinking his trip was more significant than it was, on his way to Mormonland. I was probably a lot more close-minded and ignorant than I wanted to remember.

I left Mormonism about a decade ago (after being a member for 20 years), and there’s still many years of my past entrenched in Mormonism that carved out parts of my identity. I almost never talk about it on my blog because I’m soured on the experience. Sometimes I feel like I was duped for a third of my life. In some ways, the narrator’s memory of his former self, before electroshock therapy, has some resonance for me here because I long to find myself before Mormonism brainwashed some of my thinking. What were my views and opinions of the world like before becoming a religious convert? That’s the younger version of myself I want to remember, and I turn a blind eye to the religious details of my teenage years to forget about it. 

## Parallels 

But reading about Quality, it’s hard not to wonder about some parallels here. In an interview about the book, Pirsig says Quality is akin to the Dharma in Hindu and Buddhism, which is a guidance force for the right way, actions, and path. He explains:

> By 'quality', I think and hope I'm referring to something equivalent to the term 'Dharma', a Buddhist concept. This is mentioned towards the end. I would like to draw upon the philosophical statements of the Hindus and Buddhists, who have very similar views on Dharma, only I'd substitute the term 'quality' for it, hopefully in future discussions.

> The ultimate quality, the kind of quality Phaedrus saw in the end, is a quality that can't be grasped through rational means. There are no proofs for it, no rational proofs can be given. The ultimate proof, as stated in the four-thousand-year-old Upanishads, is that he who understands this has no further doubts. It's just there, and to subject it to rational proofs is to place those proofs in a higher position than quality itself. This is what the Socratics did, you see. They said to Gorgias, 'Now you talk about the good, please tell us...'"

In the book he also says things like Quality is the Tao, the Buddha, etc. 

Quality isn’t just the undefinable measure of what makes something excellent, like not being able to describe why a particular essay is so captivating. The narrator takes it a step further, arguing that Quality is also the moving force that guides artists and engineers toward quality. These artists get on the Quality train and ride it wherever it decides to lay its tracks.

During the interview, Pirsig describes how his own writing process, and how his initial attempts to write the novel failed because he tried to force it. Instead, he had to let the novel emerge on its own, without his forcing it to be a certain thing or take a certain shape. He let himself be guided by Quality.

Mormons have a similar concept with the idea of the Holy Ghost. Yes, a primary function of the Holy Ghost is a revelator and confirmer of truth, but it’s also a quiet inner voice that leads and guides people. Mormons often talk about not knowing why they did something, they just felt strongly inside that they should do it. Like, someone might say they had a strong feeling that they should get out of a building minutes before it burns down. Or missionaries talk about being drawn to go down a certain street, not knowing why, and encountering a golden investigator (earnest truth seeker). Once a month, Mormons get up spontaneously to the pulpit, often not knowing what they’ll say, and just what they share be guided spontaneously by this inner Holy Ghost. It’s really the bedrock of Mormonism because without this inner guide, few people would ever believe the church’s founding. But by being sensitive to this inner guiding light, they find a warmth and comfort that they believe provides confirmation that they’re following the right path. 

Exactly how does Quality differ from the Holy Ghost or the Dharma? I’m not a comparative religion scholar, but there’s an idea called the Perennial Philosophy that suggests that different religions and movements experience their own expression of a common divine force. Is there a huge difference between a Mormon who listens internally and lets a guiding voice lead him a certain way from an engineer who closes his eyes, removes all thought, and lets Quality reveal to him how to troubleshoot a motorcycle?

This is perhaps why reading this book as a 17-yr-old heading off to BYU, I had this reaction. Now that I've been transparent about my dislike of my former self, here’s the passage of my journal where I talk about my initial reactions to reading ZAMM. (When I got my computer, I started typing up original entries that I’d written by hand.P)

> Today is the day before I go to the BYU leadership conference and right now I feel like anything but a leader.
> 
> Yesterday I read my scriptures and I learned so much; my mind felt so sharp. I was on top of the world. I really enjoyed II Nephi's psalm in chapter four starting on verse fifteen. Nephi says that he will write the things of his soul. That made me realize that all this time in my journal entries I haven't really been writing the things of MY soul; for the learning and profit of my children which is what I need to be doing. The reason I read books is so that the knowledge from the author of the book can be transferred to me for my own profit and learning. A good writer writes the things of his soul. As Thoreau said, "the reason I write with I is because that is the person I know best." 
> 
> I finished reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. The way I can tell if a book is good or not is if I'm on the thirty pages and I really hope that she'll never end. Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the... is a buddhist. This I should have seen a mile away but I wasn't looking. Just about everything in his book would be considered the vainness and the frailties and the foolishness of men. A brief outline of the book is as follows. The author and his son set out on a very long cross-country motorcycle trip beginning from the Dakotas and ending in Southern California. The reason why he leaves is that he is on a Chautauqua, or a search for truth. At one point on the trip when sun asks father why they are doing this he replies, "Until we find out whats wrong we just have to keep going." The trip is quite depressing really; long and unending. The book is mainly Pirsig's journals that he has compiled and abridged into one piece. 
> 
> The author starts out by pointing out that things are either technology or art, and that if anyone were to combine the two into unity then he'd be on an entirely separate level above the rest. 
> 
> "A system of concepts worked into steel." We should see things for the underlying form, the idea or science or technology behind it, rather than its outward romantic appearance. He tells the reader what kind of attitude to have when fixing his motorcycle. "Assembly of Japanese motorcycle require great peace of mind." This peace of mind is what the whole book is about. When working on a machine you have to have this peace of mind otherwise you won't be able to do it—frustration and anger will dominate and you won't solve a darn thing. 
> 
> He talks about the analytical knife that cuts to solve a problem. Fixing problems are a big with motorcycles. You can use the scientific method, and oh how wonderful the hypothesis is! Where does it come from? For christians this is the grace of God. For Buddhists this is Quality. And how does one define quality? We all know what it is but what would you say? In my opinion quality is relative to other objects and what makes one object better or more good than another? Thats the job of our internal sensors. For most people, quality isn't something to get in a tizzy fit over when you can't define it. But for Pirsig, the

> The whole world stops and he meditates and stares into blank space until he comes up with an answer. And why? What does it profit him to come up with this incredibly whimsical path that from which he thinks he knows things. In my opinion, the grace of God is an enormous benefactor to mankind.
> 
> The main point or climax of nothingness is when Pirsig says that to reach the so desired inner peace of mind one must get to zero consciousness; a blankness or nothingness of mind. This nothingness is like looking at a math problem and not having a clue as to how to solve it—just staring at it with a blank mind. Pirsig believes, actually this is getting into the Buddhist religion, that when you reach this state of consciousness that you get in touch with Quality and this gets you to the height otherwise wouldn't have flowed to you unless you were in this peace of mind state. “The way we solve problems is by entering into an entire different rationality of thought and avoiding these old outlooks and entering into another expansion of reason and from here the majority of the problems are solved.”
> 
> Pirsig attacks rationality with the fierceness of an angry mink. He says that if our reasoning methods were wrong in some aspect, then we would go around and around in circles and never really solve the problem. He says what we failed to overlook was that the problem wasn't the problem itself but rather the problem was that there was a problem in the reasoning process that tried to solve the problem, but since the reasoning process had problems it couldn't do any problem solving.
> 
> Pirsig's main trouble is that he calls his philosophy the church of reason. Therefore he makes reason as his God. His God is knowledge. The Book of Mormon says that it is wise to be learned, but only if he hearkens to the counsel of God.
> 
> Quotes I liked from the book:
> 
> * "Every step is an effort, both physically and spiritually because he imagines his goal to b external and distant.”
> 
> * "Usually your mind gets stuck when you try to do too many things at once. What you have to try to do is not force things to come."
> 
> * "The truth knocks on the door but you say 'Go away I'm looking for the truth.' So it goes away, puzzling."
> 
> * "When you want to hurry something that means you no longer care about it."
> 
> * "If someone's ungrateful and you tell him he's ungrateful fine, you haven't solved anything. You've just called him a name."
> 
> * "Analyze and cut deeper with the knife until you solve the problem."
> 
> * "Either the student works for the grade or he works for the knowledge."
> 
> * "Once they become aware that there's no single or fixed number of routes, there are as many routes as there are souls."
> 
>*  "The more you look the more you see."
> 
> * "Does quality exist in the object or the observer?"
> 
> The motorcycle trip never ends, but the depression of it does. And why does it end? Pirsig goes back to being who he really was and they both love each other again. The irony of it is that all this wonderful knowledge Pirsig discovered about quality and technology and classic and romantic and zero consciousness didn't do a darn thing for him. It was brotherly love that each of them held for each other that made the cycle run smoothly.

Now maybe you can understand a bit more of this dislike I was talking about earlier, and wanting to filter that part of me out from memory. In some ways, I missed many points of the book, but in other ways I did understand it. I just had a lot more religious baggage that I was bringing to the table at that time, and it was hard not to bring that dogma into the interpretive process.

## The resource-less REST API

Keeping with the theme of this chapter, I'm going to relate a story that will likely offend some people, but one that feels true to my experience. I was documenting a new feature of an API at work and got stuck with the reference output. The document generator we use (a homegrown tool) was supposed to list the resources of the API, followed by the methods available to get the resource. And that resource was some traffic conditions for roads. 

I spent about two hours trying to figure out why the tool wouldn't identify the resource in the output. I tried adding custom keyword parameters in the source -- a technique I'd used elsewhere -- to configure the generator's output, but didn't have luck. I kept trying different combinations of the collection's name to try to get the tool to generate the right output. Nothing worked. I scanned frequently asked questions, every parameter in the documentation, random team notes on using the tool, our codebase for frequency of the right commands, interfaced with the engineer, and more. Every time I generated the docs, the page came up bare, saying only that there was no resource for the API.

I had already done my Calm Meditation that morning while riding the train into work. And I was fairly calm, but trying permutation after permutation to get the output right was making me frustrated. I decided to do another calm meditation. I walked over to a nearby empty room, sat down on a chair, and did another calm meditation. For 10 minutes I listened to my breath going in and out, and other physical sensations to get out of my monkey mind. I did my best to let my thoughts float away from my head. I needed a reset, a way to see this problem fresh, with new eyes, without bringing in all the assumptions of my previous troubleshooting attempts.

After the calm meditation, as I was heading back to my desk, I had a feeling that I should look more carefully at the API where I'd configured the document generator to identify the resource, and compare this working model against the broken model to identify the discrepancy. Yes, I thought, this is a good approach -- start with the model that works, study it, understand the configuration, and then see what's lacking in the other documentation. This idea surfaced in my mind because I'd done this reset, clearing away my other troubleshooting efforts, which had spiraled into endless variations of the collection name in the document generator's configuration.

After 20 minutes after the meditation, the engineer finally realized what I was asking her and said, oh, this is isn't a resource-based API. In other words, the API is just a method. I didn't even realize you could have a REST API that didn't have resources. Anyway, the technical details are totally irrelevant here. Suffice it to say, the document generator couldn't identify the resource because the API didn't have resources.

I needed a break and went to eat lunch. While eating, I started thinking about how, when I was Mormon, I used to pray in a similar way, at times of frustration at not being able to find a solution. Most commonly, I would pray to find a lost thing, like keys. But there were other times, not too different from scenarios like this. And after the prayer, I would often feel impressed by a particular idea surfacing in my mind. If looking for a lost item, a new idea would come to me about where to look. Or if racked with anxiety about a big decision, after praying I would often settle on some thought or feeling that I didn't have before. I assumed this was some kind of answer to the prayer. 

But now I started to think, maybe I just experienced the new emerging detail from resetting my mind, like with the calm meditation. The narrator explains that one gumption trap is one where we're stuck with a certain view of things, and we can't see the other detail. We're filtering it out, blind to it. Slowing down and learning to see these unnoticed parts leads to open-mindedness for new facts to present themselves. These new facts often trigger new ideas about the resolution. The narrator explains:


As the course description of gumptionology indicated, this internal part of
the field can be broken down into three main types of internal gumption
traps: those that block affective understanding, called "value traps"; those
that block cognitive understanding, called "truth traps"; and those that
block psychomotor behavior, called "muscle traps." The value traps are by
far the largest and the most dangerous group.
Of the value traps, the most widespread and pernicious is value rigidity. This
is an inability to revalue what one sees because of commitment to previous
values. In motorcycle maintenance, you must rediscover what you do as you
go. Rigid values make this impossible.
The typical situation is that the motorcycle doesn't work. The facts are there
but you don't see them. You're looking right at them, but they don't yet have
enough value. This is what Phædrus was talking about. Quality, value,
creates the subjects and objects of the world. The facts do not exist until
value has created them. If your values are rigid you can't really learn new
facts.
This often shows up in premature diagnosis, when you're sure you know
what the trouble is, and then when it isn't, you're stuck. Then you've got to
find some new clues, but before you can find them you've got to clear your
head of old opinions. If you're plagued with value rigidity you can fail to see
320
the real answer even when it's staring you right in the face because you can't
see the new answer's importance.
The birth of a new fact is always a wonderful thing to experience. It's
dualistically called a "discovery" because of the presumption that it has an
existence independent of anyone's awareness of it. When it comes along, it
always has, at first, a low value. Then, depending on the value-looseness of
the observer and the potential quality of the fact, its value increases, either
slowly or rapidly, or the value wanes and the fact disappears.
The overwhelming majority of facts, the sights and sounds that are around
us every second and the relationships among them and everything in our
memory...these have no Quality, in fact have a negative quality. If they were
all present at once our consciousness would be so jammed with meaningless
data we couldn't think or act. So we preselect on the basis of Quality, or, to
put it Phædrus' way, the track of Quality preselects what data we're going to
be conscious of, and it makes this selection in such a way as to best
harmonize what we are with what we are becoming.
What you have to do, if you get caught in this gumption trap of value
rigidity, is slow down...you're going to have to slow down anyway whether
you want to or not...but slow down deliberately and go over ground that
you've been over before to see if the things you thought were important
were really important and to -- well -- just stare at the machine. There's
nothing wrong with that. Just live with it for a while. Watch it the way you
watch a line when fishing and before long, as sure as you live, you'll get a
little nibble, a little fact asking in a timid, humble way if you're interested in
it. That's the way the world keeps on happening. Be interested in it.
At first try to understand this new fact not so much in terms of your big
problem as for its own sake. That problem may not be as big as you think it
is. And that fact may not be as small as you think it is. It may not be the fact
you want but at least you should be very sure of that before you send the
fact away. Often before you send it away you will discover it has friends who
are right next to it and are watching to see what your response is. Among
the friends may be the exact fact you are looking for.
321
After a while you may find that the nibbles you get are more interesting than
your original purpose of fixing the machine. When that happens you've
reached a kind of point of arrival. Then you're no longer strictly a
motorcycle mechanic, you're also a motorcycle scientist, and you've
completely conquered the gumption trap of value rigidity. (319-320)

The controversy I alluded to at the start is to suggest that both prayer leads to new ideas surfacing in the same way that meditation, clearing the mind, leads to new "revelations" as well. Had I understood that at 17, I might not have been so pigheaded and dogmatic. Those times I lost my keys and took 5 minutes to pray, and then instantly knew where they were, wasn't because of some divine guidance. It was probably because of what Pirsig said, I slowed down, I cleared my mind of previous assumptions, I relaxed and let myself be guided by something other than my monkey mind, and lo and behold, doing this allowed for new facts to present themselves to my mind, and I got an idea for the solution that I didn't have before.
