On my way into work one morning, I forgot my phone. This turned out to lead to small revelation in noticing details around me. Usually I'm listening to podcasts, plugging along at about 13 mph along bike paths, with few stop lights. But on this day, because I forgot my phone, I decided to take the city route, which involves about 15 stops but goes through the heart of Seattle. The city route is the route I used to take for about 2 years, until I discovered the longer, calmer route following the water.

As I proceeded to ride through the city, from King street station to Fremont by way of 2nd Avenue, I realized I'd forgotten how visually stimulating the ride is. Lights everywhere -- streetlights, stoplights, blinking lights from tow trucks, pedestrian lights, bike lights, headlights from cars, neon lights in store windows, and more. It was a visual cornicopia, almost like a light show.

And sounds too -- from cars, bikes, buses, people, homeless people talking to themselves, people talking on cell phones while they walked, horns honking, crows cawing as they pick apart trash in the road, and more.


visuals -- skyscrapers shooting straight up, signs I'd never seen/noticed before, constant anticipation of turning cars or pedestrians meandering in front of me.

And touch -- the cool drops of a light, intermittent rain. The cold weather on my cheeks. You get the picture. It's a sensory stimulating ride. I was used to the shoreline ride that offers some breathtaking views of the sound and ships in the harbor but isn't a sensory overload/journey like it is riding through the city.

All this I noticed because I didn't have my attention elsewhere, on the podcast. And because I hadn't taken the route in many months. When I was taking the route daily, I'd become more familiar and somewhat desensitized to it all, adopting the cliche motions of an experienced local who isn't awestruck by anything like tourists are, standing still and looking all around them like they're lost or seeing something for the first time.


On my way home, I also rode through the city. This time rain was falling harder and it was dark, and many drivers just wanted to get home, so I was frequently looking this way and that, anticipating every car exiting a parking garage as someone blind to my oncoming motion, slowing down until their car stopped and they appeared to see me. Even with all this anticipation, I was still moving at a fast clip, about 9mph, through the city blocks. I couldn't focus my attention on the other visual stimuli like I had in the morning because I needed to prioritize my focus on the car hazards and wandering pedestrians.

This made me think about what Pirsig said about troubleshooting: the first step is to slow way day. When you slow down, you can take in more detail, more facts that you previously weren't noticing because you were going too fast. Just like speeding through the city on my bike, I mostly just took note of the cars and stoplights. But slowing down, I stretched my neck back to look at the Smith tower observatory (42 floors) and later the Wells Fargo skyscraper (easily twice the height of the Smith tower), and wondered why one building was made from a certain stone and others of another stone type.

When you slow down, you take in more details. But there's another idea: by changing my route, I reset my familiarity with the area. Even if I'd slowed down on my coastline route, which I was accustomed to riding every morning, I wouldn't have seen as many details as the city route that I hadn't taken for many months. This is why Pirsig says to clear your mind, so that you can remove those familiar ruts where you've learned to focus on certain details and become blind to others.

I think learning to see is much of what art is all about. In Rob Walker's The Art of Noticing, he draws upon many ideas from artists about how they shifted their perspective to see the familiar in a new light. For example.....



In much the same way, to troubleshoot something, you might need to escape the familiar ruts that have caused you to miss certain detail. You have to shift your way of seeing to something new, by looking at things from another angle. That other angle might be from another person's perspective, perhaps the user's perspective, or from another technology platform, or from another role type. Walker provides 131 techniques for this, but the one that works the best for me is simply this: wherever you are, try to notice 3 new details around you haven't noticed before. It's kind of an amazing experience when it works.

I remember sitting in my kids' high school gym one day, during an awards assembly in which parents were invited. As you might expect, the assembly was a bit boring. So I started to play the noticing game. I traced my attention through the many hanging pendants, and one detail led to a question: why was the school so strong in cheerleading, while virtually never winning in other sports, such as football? The newly noticed details led to new questions, and those questions exapdned my curiosity into new avenues.


here's the rub: at the very time you need to slow down and take in more details, that's the time it's the hardest. when you're troublehsooting and are in a hurry or frustrated and have slipped into the mode of trying endless permutations hoping one will eventually work, that's when it's hard to slow down. at this point you need meditation...
