## The bathroom fan motor 

As it was Thanksgiving weekend, we had family visiting, including my wife's brother Ryan, who is a doctor but who also loves working on cars and probably should have been a mechanic instead. He's the kind of guy who has multiple cars in different states in his yard, working on them for fun. He likes to take things apart, see how they work, and fix them. We had a bathroom fan motor that gave up the ghost, and my wife had ordered a new one. While people were cooking, she suggested that Ryan and I install the new fan motor. She knew he couldn't resist this invitation to fix something in our house.

I figured this might be a good opportunity to learn how the engineering mind works, to see it in action. I gathered up some tools, a ladder, the new fan motor, and we proceeded to the bathroom to make the switch. 

Replacing a bathroom fan motor would be relatively easy if you first knew what replacement parts you needed and also had them. Sadly, our house was 30 years old and the original fan motor was unidentifiable. My wife ordered a fan motor that fit another bathroom fan in our house (a smaller, powder bathroom), since we swapped that out the year previously. However, this current bathroom fan project (for the primary suite bathroom) was a different sort, as it had a heat lamp too. 

Ryan climbed the ladder and removed the old motor + fan. He took note of its position, said it would be good to take a picture but didn't, and set the old motor + fan on the counter in the same position as it was installed. So far, so good. Anyone knows that as you take something apart, you take careful note of how it was put together so that you can reassemble it later. The ZAMM narrator explains a similar technique in his section on gumption traps:

> The second technique for preventing the out-of- sequence-reassembly gumption trap is newspapers opened out on the floor of the garage on which all the parts are laid left-to-right and top-to-bottom in the order in which you read a page. That way when you put it back together in reverse order the little screws and washers and pins that can be easily overlooked are brought to your attention as you need them. (315)

All was going smoothly, except that when we tried to reinstall the new motor and fan, the plastic fan blade's diameter was a quarter inch too wide for the vent hole. It was also propeller-style fan rather than a squirrel cage fan. Ryan looked at the fan blade and tried to put the old fan blade on instead of the new one. There wasn't room in the vent hole to accommodate the squirrel-cage fan blade because the motor's shaft was too long, pushing it further into the vent space. 

At this point, we returned out attention to the propeller-style fan, and Ryan offered two workarounds. He said we could sand down the plastic fan so that it would fit into the hole. Or we could use some tin snips and make the hole larger.

Both solutions seemed poor to me. I didn't think using a hand sander to reduce the diameter of a fan would work &mdash; surely it would make the fan, which would be spinning about a hundred times per minute, somewhat asymmetrical in places, leading to a loud, whirling, clunky fan blade as it spun around the shaft. Cutting the hole larger with tin snips seemed more practical, but still seemed wrong. Why should we have to cut the hole in the first place? 

We gave up on the repair and ate Thanksgiving dinner together, and eventually Ryan left. Upon leaving, he said to tell him how the fan project turned out. 

That night I started browsing Amazon for more fan motors, wondering if anyone else had to resort to these measures. In looking at the fan motors, I saw many motors with squirrel cages and realized that my wife didn't purchase the right one, as there were others more similar to our original. 

It puzzled me that Ryan's first response, upon seeing the motor didn't fit, wasn't to order a different motor with the right-sized fan but rather to modify the situation to make it work. I asked my wife why her genius brother, who fixes cars for fun, didn't stop to think of a third solution to the problem: get a part that actually fits?

My wife explained that this is her family's way, and that her brother had learned it from her father. She describes the method as "make it work." The idea is that in your mind, you say, here's what I have, and here's what I need to do. How can I make it work? They have resourcefulness and frugality baked into their minds &mdash; it's just how their family thinks. 

I ordered a fan motor with a squirrel cage and waited two days for it to arrive. When it arrived, I attempted to insert it into the space, but the shaft was too long and there wasn't space enough for the fan in the vent. I returned to Amazon and browsed around for fans with a shorter shaft and ordered another model, hoping it would fit.

There's an early scene in _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ where the narrator badly wants to help John get into some maintenance tasks and notices John's handlebars are slipping a bit. He proposes fixing them with a shim made from a beer can, but John doesn't want to do that. This is similar to Ryan wanting to fix the fan with a clever hack. The narrator explains:

> His handlebars had started slipping. Not badly, he said, just a little when you shoved hard on them. I warned him not to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He agreed to use my metric sockets and box-ends.
> 
> When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the slippage, because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.
> 
> "You're going to have to shim those out," I said.
> 
> "What's shim?"
> 
> "It's a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines."
> 
> "Oh," he said. He was getting interested. "Good. Where do you buy them?"
> "I've got some right here," I said gleefully, holding up a can of beer in my hand.
> 
> He didn't understand for a moment. Then he said, "What, the can?"
> 
> "Sure," I said, "best shim stock in the world."
> 
> I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him money.
> 
> But to my surprise he didn't see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.
> 
> As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!
> 
> _Ach, du lieber!_ [Oh, you dear!]
>
> Since then we have had very few conversations about motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.
> 
> You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without knowing why. 
> 
> I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the application. Aluminum doesn't oxidize in wet weather...or, more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.
> 
> In other words, any true German mechanic, with a half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have concluded that this particular solution to this particular technical problem was perfect. (55-56)

I could see Ryan explaining to his wife on the way home how easy it would have been to simply sand down the previous fan motor, as plastic is meant to be adjustable and how it would have solved the problem in 10 minutes. 

Did Ryan's mind operate like the narrator's, and mine like John's? Ryan proposed a solution of modifying the existing fan to fit, using the available materials &mdash; a sander, or tin snips. To me that solution didn't seem right, but maybe my reaction was to think that there was an official part and official way to do it, and I didn't want a hack job. Every time I turned on the fan, I didn't want to wonder about the noise, the clunky rotation of the fan, and remember how we hacked it to fit. In the same way, I don't think John wanted to look down at his handlebars and see a Coors Light can holding them tight.

You might think at this point, because the narrator has superior mechanical acumen, that I've got my tin snips out and am ready to widen the vent hole to make my bathroom fan fit, just like Ryan suggested, but no. I decided to wait for the new motor to arrive and see if it fit better. I didn't have high confidence in my tin-snipping ability and my prowess at "making things work," at least not for this scenario.

A few days later the new fan arrived. It fit easily into the space. The attaching bracket was half an inch too short, but I fixed the gap with a large rubber spacer (from my random collection of nuts, bolts, and washers). The fan for this new motor was made of cheap tin (and noisy), so I ended up putting the old fan onto the new shaft instead. Overall, I still spent an hour fiddling with the right angle and approach, but it worked. 

I started to second guess Ryan's approach even more. Suppose he came over to work on my car (an offer he has extended multiple times, even though nothing is wrong with my car). Let's say I'm working on my brakes and changing the rotors. I ordered what I thought were the right rotors but let's just say they were slightly the wrong model. Would he try to make it work rather than re-ordering the correct part? Surely this becomes non-sensical in the extreme. There's merit to being patient enough to get the right part for the job. The experienced mechanic probably has a good sense of when you can implement a clever hack versus when you really need the right part.

My solution for the bathroom fan motor did involve a bit of non-standard thinking, adding the rubber spacer to close the gap due to the too-short bracket, and using the old fan blade instead of the new alumninum one. I wondered if maybe there was another way to look at this problem. Instead of trying to "make it work," there's merit in being patient enough to "do it right." Knowing when to *make it work* versus when to *do it right* is an art.

## Many ways through a job

In another part of *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, in a section about barbecue assembly instructions that fail John, the narrator explains that there are multiple paths through a system, and that just because the instructions come from the factory, it doesn't mean the instructions are the "right" way to do it. The narrator says that in reality, the technical writer ends up getting all his or her information from a low-level foreman (the only one the manager wants to make available). This person tells the technical writer one way to do it, and that becomes the way described in the manual. But it's certainly not the *only* way. The narrator explains: 

> What's really angering about [barbecue assembly] instructions of this sort is that they imply there's only one way to put this rotisserie together...their way. And that presumption wipes out all the creativity. Actually there are hundreds of ways to put the rotisserie together and when they make you follow just one way without showing you the overall problem the instructions become hard to follow in such a way as not to make mistakes. You lose feeling for the work. And not only that, it's very unlikely that they've told you the best way."
> 
> "But they're from the factory," John says.
> 
> "I'm from the factory too," I say "and I know how instructions like this are put together. You go out on the assembly line with a tape recorder and the foreman sends you to talk to the guy he needs least, the biggest goof-off he's got, and whatever he tells you...that's the instructions. The next guy might have told you something completely different and probably better, but he's too busy." They all look surprised. "I might have known," DeWeese says.
> 
> "It's the format," I say. "No writer can buck it. Technology presumes there's just one right way to do things and there never is. And when you presume there's just one right way to do things, of course the instructions begin and end exclusively with the rotisserie. But if you have to choose among an infinite number of ways to put it together then the relation of the machine to you, and the relation of the machine and you to the rest of the world, has to be considered, because the selection from many choices, the art of the work is just as dependent upon your own mind and spirit as it is upon the material of the machine. That's why you need the peace of mind."
> 
> "Actually this idea isn't so strange," I continue. "Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you'll see the difference. The craftsman isn't ever following a single line of instruction. He's making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he'll be absorbed and attentive to what he's doing even though he doesn't deliberately contrive this. His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn't following any set of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material at hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of changes until his mind's at rest at the same time the material's right."
> 
> "Sounds like art," the instructor says.
> 
> "Well, it is art," I say. "This divorce of art from technology is completely unnatural. It's just that it's gone on so long you have to be an archeologist to find out where the two separated."

In other words, there isn't a single path through a problem, as instruction manuals suggest. There are hundreds of ways to go about something. An experienced craftsman rarely follows a single path of instructions but makes decisions as he or she goes along.

Even though I found Ryan's workarounds so strange (the sander, the tin snips), they do encapsulate the narrator's mindset here. From my point of view, there was a correct part and a correct installation procedure, and it shouldn't involve using tin snips to widen holes or sanders to reduce the fan's diameter. But even if Ryan's ideas were wrong, the direction wasn't. He didn't see a single path through a problem, nor a single way of doing something. Instead, he saw multiple options to solving a problem, multiple paths to achieving the solution. He had an open mind to consider the merits of multiple options.

## An analogy about driving routes 

A similar scenario happens during driving. My wife goes to Costco regularly (10 miles away), and she knows multiple ways to get there. I rarely go to Costco, so when I'm driving, I'm careful to stick to the route I know, and sometimes I need Google Maps to get me through the final bit of turns. I'm a novice in the area, and as a novice I lean towards a single, simple route to achieve my goal. Like installing the fan motor, I wanted a simple set of steps to replace the fan, or a single set of steps to bleed my brakes. 

But the more advanced driver who knows the area sees multiple paths to get to Costco. My wife might prefer one route when it's busy, and another route when it's less busy or when she has other errands to run. In the same way, a more advanced engineer might see 10 different ways of solving a problem, and lean towards one or other other based on various factors. As the narrator explains, the experienced craftsman "isn't following any set of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines his [or her] thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material at hand." The craftsman makes decisions on the fly based on judgements and intuitions about the project at each progression of the work.

## Steps in technical writing 

As a technical writer, I'm usually a novice with the technology I'm documenting. I'm often looking for a set of steps to achieve an end goal, and as soon as I find a path, I sometimes latch onto it, without acknowledging that there are multiple paths a user could conceivably take. At some point in my career, I came to believe that even if there are 5 different ways to do something, you should pick the simplest approach and document only that approach, potentially acknowledging that there are other approaches. If you documented the 5 different ways of doing something, it would mushroom the size and scope of the documentation, making it unnecessarily large. Plus, you end up confusing users who now have to decide which path to take and why. And if you include all these alternative approaches, now you're forced to explain the merits of the different approaches. You might not know the merits, so this means more research and talking with different engineers, who might just have varying opinions without more solid reasons. Those reasons might lead to larger technological philosophies and such. And why bother when you've already found a way of getting it to work?

But now I see that the single path through a problem creates a fiction that misguides users. It leads people to think there's a single and right way to do something, when there usually isn't. This is how documentation creates a kind of narrative fiction in the user's head.

In addition to only showing a single set of steps, instruction guides rarely acknowledge when a step sequence is optional or required. For example, when you're assembling a dresser you bought from IKEA, the manual doesn't acknowledge details like these: "You can do these 5 steps in any order, but you have to finish these 5 steps before the 6th step because the 6th step can only be completed once the 5th step is complete." IKEA manuals don't even have words, so there's no way to communicate optionality versus required orders of steps, and like I said before, noting optional versus required sequences involves extra verbiage and explanation, so it's easier to just assume that all steps are required to be done in the exact order noted in the assembly. 

As a result, most users, especially novices like me, go about the manual in a religious way, making sure to complete each and every step accurately and thoroughly before proceeding to the next one. The problem is that as soon as we get stuck with one step, it can present an insurmountable situation. Our rigid, step-by-step mindset can't get to the next step while believing the previous one is incomplete. The more experienced assembler might not be blocked when steps don't work but rather figures out another way.

## Opting to provide no documentation to avoid prescriptive product usage

There's an even more extreme perspective on this argument about multiple paths through a procedure: providing no documentation at all because you don't want to dictate to users how they should use the product. In the interview, Casey Newton asks Sam if he would do anything differently in retrospect, such as helping prepare people more. Sam responds:

> Sam Altman: Now, the second thing is, should we have released more of a how-to manual? And I honestly don’t. No, I think we could have done some things there that would have been helpful, but I really believe that it’s not optimal for tech companies to tell people, like, here is how to use this technology and here’s how to do whatever. And the organic thing that happened there actually was pretty good.
> 
> Casey Newton: Yeah. I’m curious about the thing that you just said about, we thought it was important to get this stuff into folks’ hands sooner rather than later. Say more about why that is.
> 
> Sam Altman: More time to adapt for our institutions and leaders to understand, for people to think about what the next version of the model should do, what they’d like, what would be useful, what would not be useful, what would be really bad, how society and the economy need to co-evolve.
> 
> Like, the thing that many people in the field or adjacent to the field have advocated or used to advocate for, which I always thought was super bad, was, this is so disruptive, such a big deal. It’s got to be done in secret by the small group of us that can understand it. And then, we will fully build the AGI and push a button all at once when it’s ready. And I think that’d be quite, quite bad.
> 
> Casey Newton: Yeah, because it would just be way too much change too fast.
> Sam Altman: Yeah. Again, society and technology have to co-evolve, and people have to decide what’s going to work for them and how they want to use it. And you can criticize OpenAI about many, many things, but we do try to really listen to people and adapt it in ways that make it better or more useful. And I think we’re able to do that. But we wouldn’t get it right without that feedback.

In other words, OpenAI didn't want to tell people how to use the technology. They wanted people to decide for themselves what was most useful. Providing documentation would prescribe a certain fate for the product, limiting the creative application by defining the product's end goals and procedures. 

I've heard similar things about APIs from product managers (PMs). When asked why we don't provide more sample code and instructions for various use cases, PMs say we don't want to tell users how they can use the APIs. We want to invite them to use them creatively for whatever solution they need.

OpenAI recently released custom GPTs, a feature that lets you customize the GPT experience based on instructions you provide an sources you upload. Although it was the most discussed feature from their Developer Day event, there wasn't any documentation for it.

What drove me crazy was to see no documentation for the "Upload files" button, especially because I kept receiving errors about uploads being too big, or uploading a format that GPT couldn't read, or getting errors about reading the uploads. I was surprised that other people weren't demanding more product documentation. I even opened a thread on their OpenAI forums. 

It wasn't until this Hard Fork podcast that the light bulb turned on about the reasons why: they saw documentation as a way of limiting the user's creativity with the product. If there's no docs, then you can do whatever you want with the product! If there is documentation, though, then you force people to follow your petty little steps and achieve the same end. Sam explains:

> I think this is, like, a great example of people understanding the technology, making smart decisions with it. Society and the technology co-evolving together. Like, what you see is that people are using it where appropriate and where it’s helpful, and not using it where you shouldn’t.
> 
> And for all of the fear that people have had, both users and companies seem to really understand the limitations and are making appropriate decisions about where to roll it out. It &mdash; the kind of controllability, reliability, whatever you want to call it &mdash; that is going to get much better. I think we’ll see a big step forward there over the coming years.
