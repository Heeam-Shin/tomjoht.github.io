Removing deadline pressure
A key strategy for remaining calm is to remove the pressure of deadlines. With my bike, my front brake still worked; only the back brake was inoperable. The front brake supplies 70% of the braking power anyway, making the back brake somewhat unnecessary. There really is no deadline for fixing it.

With other tasks, having a tight deadline can spike stress levels. Deadlines are somewhat interesting because for some people, deadlines create the necessary pressure for action. My college-age daughter often waits until the last minute to write her essays because she says she works better that way. However, I think it’s hard to cultivate a peace of mind when you’re working under extreme pressure like this. Without going too far into this point, for peace of mind wouldn’t it be better to remove the pressure of deadlines altogether? The narrator seems to agree:

> Impatience is best handled by allowing an indefinite time for the job, particularly new jobs that require unfamiliar techniques; by doubling the allotted time when circumstances force time planning; and by scaling down the scope of what you want to do. Overall goals must be scaled down in importance and immediate goals must be scaled up. This requires value flexibility, and the value shift is usually accompanied by some loss of gumption, but it's a sacrifice that must be made. It's nothing like the loss of gumption that will occur if a Big Mistake caused by impatience occurs. (p.326)

To remove the pressure of deadlines, you have to plan properly. This means prioritizing tasks appropriately so that you’re working on the most important tasks first, well ahead of their due dates. This is also a tremendously difficult skill, but when you implement good planning, this can be wonderful.

When my second oldest daughter was applying to college, I outlined a list of tasks they needed to complete, and we worked toward completing those tasks for specific deadlines. The main task was writing the personal essays on the college applications, which required multiple drafts and revisions. Because we planned time for this, by the time the early admissions deadlines rolled around, my daughter already had the essays written and ready to go. Their essay told a fantastic story, by the way, and they got into every college they applied to. 

I’ve had other similar experiences about properly prioritizing work so that it’s ready by the deadline. I won’t belabor this point because it’s somewhat obvious. There’s nothing like a time crunch in the face of confusing tasks that will yank you out of your peace of mind. And when you operate in a state of frenetic, frantic chaos, you’re bound to lack the patience for success. If I were full of frenzy and stress, do you think I could continue alternating between learning processes from Youtube videos to trying them out in my garage, back to learning, then trying some more, learning, and trying some more? No, I would haven’t tapped out much too early. 

The problem with planning and prioritization, and one that I’ll have to return to later in this series, is that it might run counter to some Taoist ideas. Like the parable of the old man who falls into the raging river, you’re supposed to go with the flow, not struggling against a natural order and harmony. Even so, this doesn’t mean falling back on laziness and indulging yourself in whatever you want. It’s more about tapping into an intrinsic desire for something, and then feeling your way toward it. Like I said, I’ll return to this theme later in the series.
