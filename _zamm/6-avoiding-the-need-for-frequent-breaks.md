# Avoiding the need for frequent breaks

Excited by the progress I’d made working on my bike, I decided to incorporate a 10-minute meditation before starting work. After identifying the highest priority task for the day — one that I’d been putting off for weeks — I quietly padded over to our Meditation room for another Calm Meditation session. 

Yes, our workplace actually has a Meditation room, if you can believe it. Sadly, for years I’d never used it to actually meditate, and now the room was under active remodel, so all items had been removed except the carpeted floor, making it an empty room. Ironically, I think this layout was more appropriate than the previous furniture in the room (which had included a lazy-boy chair, bookcase, throw pillows, and lamp). The point of meditation is to empty your mind, so why not start by emptying the room of all items?

I sat down, leaned against a wall, and listened to the meditation. With a belly full of breakfast and an uncomfortable sitting position, it was harder to concentrate on my breathing. I wasn’t emotionally opposed to doing the documentation work ahead of me, so I didn’t feel a transforming calm effect after the meditation. It was only okay. Afterwards, I returned to my desk and started on my task. 

My documentation task for the day was to summarize the main capabilities of an internal group, as part of an internal documentation project I was participating in. I started by reading some internal websites and then gravitated toward an introductory video the group posted. Instead of skipping through the video, I had the patience to watch all 25 minutes of it. I continued gathering and refining my notes on the capabilities list until I had a representative list of 5 bullet points. 

This task only consumed my morning, but I was exhausted. I started to realize something: My brain isn’t just a sieve that can continue collecting more and more information. There needs to be some kind of actionable component to the learning. When working on my bike, I alternated between learning and doing, but with this documentation task, the main action involved learning and writing only. 

I decided to go on a walk to refresh and reset myself. I walked over the Vintage Mall in Fremont and browsed the vintage items — from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I noticed a lot of wool cardigans — my favorite article of clothing — and wondered if my own fashion style was dated in the 80s. I reflected on how many of these vintage items were from the time of my childhood (a photo of Jack Sikma on the Supersonics, a cord telephone in the shape of a football, some old trucker hats), and why they were so appealing. Was the appeal of these items their pre-Internet era — a time so inconceivable to today’s immersion in screens, smartphones, and social media? This made me wonder about another idea: interruptions from social media.

In a previous series, [Journey away from smartphones](https://idratherbewriting.com/smartphones/overview.html), I wrote about how giving up my smartphone for six weeks led me to reading books again, and how this was a significant revelation, as I’d never considered that my smartphone had caused me to give up book reading. Were disruptions like this antithetical to my desire to get immersed in the task at hand?

Maybe. Earlier in the morning, after I’d returned from the Meditation room, I opened my computer to see a chat message telling me about an issue on a product landing page that needed to be fixed. Two products had the same description. I had to fix it so that I could focus on my priority task. 

In another chat thread, someone posted a position paper to an AI tech writers group I participate in. I had to read the paper — again interrupting my focus. Someone else chatted me to ask if we could alphabetize a list of reference tables.

Other interruptions were internal ones: I had to check the latest goings-on in the OpenAI chaos, to see what internal memes were appearing on the matter, to see the latest news on the New York Times, the sports updates on ESPN from yesterday’s games, to check Linkedin to see if anyone commented on my latest podcast.

Why do we welcome small interruptions like this? Wouldn’t it be better to shut everything off and focus entirely on the task at hand? Instead, I seemed to welcome these small respites from the task at hand.

Perhaps I welcome these breaks because focusing in an immersive way is hard. It’s hard to sustain the intake of information in a constant way, processing and organizing and articulating all of the information. In the same way that I usually can’t write for more than a couple of hours at a time, learning new material has the same exhausting effect — hence the desire for small breaks like I mentioned.

Wouldn’t it be so much better not to need the breaks? What if I could get into a state of flow, erasing time? How could I surrender to the ebbs and swirls of the river?

I wrote about focus in my Journey away from smartphones series. After summarizing [techniques for deep work](https://idratherbewriting.com/smartphones/newport-deep-work.html) from Cal Newport, I tried to sustain 90-minute focus sessions, shutting off all distractions. While productive, I found these focus sessions grueling, to the point that they made writing no fun. Muting all interruptions to focus exclusively on the task at hand felt the equivalent of going into a gym and doing non-stop bench-presses for the full hour, but with my mind.

This frustration with the 90-minute sessions led me [the idea of flow](https://idratherbewriting.com/smartphones/from-focus-sessions-to-flow.html) as a possible solution, and I [poured through Csikszentmihaly’s writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/smartphones/csikszentmihalyi-dynamics-of-flow.html). Csikszentmihaly, a Hungarian psychologist, says flow is a state in which you’re so engrossed in an activity that you lose track of time. “... the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours” (49). Your motions become effortless as you dissolve into the task at hand, which is a perfect match for your skills and abilities. Feedback loops in the task prompt your next moves in an interactive game-like state. When you’re engaged in flow, you expel the monkey mind from your consciousness and become lost in the activity. You’re fully present in the activity.

I longed to get into states of flow at work, hoping that it would remove the tediousness of the 90-minute focus sessions. But even when I shut off all distractions (chat, phone, browser), the flow states didn’t kick in for more than 20 minutes at a time. Perhaps the conditions weren’t right. Perhaps I was misunderstanding something. Csikszentmihalyi explains:

> “Why is solitude such a negative experience? The bottom-line answer is that keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, constant stimulation, and feedback to keep our attention directed. And when external input is lacking, attention begins to wander, and thoughts become chaotic—resulting in the state we have called “psychic entropy” in chapter 2. (168-69)

I started to think about Csikszentmihalyi’s flow in the context of _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. When you’re working on a motorcycle, there’s an external object you’re interfacing with. The activity isn’t all in your mind. You’re turning a wrench on a bolt, expelling and refilling reservoirs of fluid, troubleshooting stuck screws, taking apart engine components, sucking out mineral fluid with a syringe, and more. You’re not in a state of continual reading and learning on a screen or book. Instead, you have a physically interactive scenario. Just like my need for a walk, perhaps I needed to better alternate learning and doing.

The constant switch between learning and doing (praxis, or putting theory into practice) is an implicit theme in _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. One appeal of the book is the interplay between the motorcycle trip and the narrator’s philosophical musings. Either mode without the other would leave the book feeling flat. Descriptions of the ride alone would be a travelog, no different from other road trips. But pepper in the philosophy, and move back and forth between philosophy and riding, such that the two modes amplify each other in thematic ways, and this movement creates delight in the reading experience.

This balance is similar to other ideas. The cresting wave in Taoism represents the interplay between states. The cresting wave represents the peak and violence of water at its highest point, ready to crash against the water below. The wave is an alternate state from the calm seas that gently rock back and forth. This interplay between calm seas and cresting waves seems reflected in the interplay between riding your motorcycle (physical action) and philosophical musing (intellectual action).

## Immersion in the user experience

In “The Most Famous Yet Unusual Technical Writer,” Charles Beck argues that the narrator’s motorcycle travel represents the user experience. When you travel by motorcycle, you’re out in the elements, in the rain or sun or freezing cold, and you’re experiencing the raw environment rather than being separated from it inside the artificial environment of a car. Beck writes:

> Within his genre of travel narrative, Pirsig's mode of travel conjures for me the need to focus on the user. Travel by motorcycle is not an abstract "mode of travel," designed to "consume so much time," and "requiring so much fuel." Pirsig is not concerned so much with "how can the machine get me there" as with "what do I perceive when interacting with the machine." In essence, Pirsig describes the user's perspective. 

> 

> The user's view, in this case, contrasts with that of the motorcycle designer, the mechanic, and especially the travel agent. The human-machine interaction within a given context forms the basis of his perspective. In a colorful way, Pirsig is saying that effective communication requires that writers must come as close as possible to the user's scene or context. Until they do so, they can't comprehend the way users will approach the document.

On my motorcycle rides, this immersion in the elements is something I remember vividly. One day, I was riding down a long road you could see for miles. In the distance, I could see dark clouds and sky enveloping the landscape, and I saw that I was riding directly into a storm. I knew that I was going to get wet, there was no avoiding it. And I did get soaked in the rain, but before long, I was past it, and the wind blowing through my clothes dried me out. It wasn’t long before I saw blue sky again, and I was mostly dry. To be wet and then dried like this is kind of unreal. 

In some parts of the narrator’s journey, the narrator and his group rode through intense heat:

> In the restaurant I try to comment on this but no one is interested. John and Sylvia look really out of it. They just sit and soak up the air-conditioned air without a move. The waitress comes for the order and that snaps them out of it a little, but they are not ready and so she goes away again.

> 

> "I don't think I want to leave here," Sylvia says.

> An image of the elderly man outside in the wide- brimmed hat comes back to me. "Think what it was like around here before air conditioning," I say.

> "I am," she says.

> 

> "With the roads this hot and that bad back tire of mine, we shouldn't go more than sixty," I say.

>

> No comment from them.

> Chris, in contrast to them, seems to be back to his normal self, alert and watching everything. When the food comes he wolfs it down and then, before we are half-finished, asks for more. He gets it and we wait for him to finish.

> 

> Miles later and the heat is just ferocious. Sunglasses and goggles are not enough for this glare. You need a welder's mask.

> 

> The High Plains break up into washed-out and gullied hills. It is all bright whitish tan. Not a blade of grass anywhere. Just scattered weed stalks and rocks and sand. The black of the highway is a relief to look at so I stare down at it and study how the blur whizzes by underfoot. Beside it I see the left exhaust pipe has picked up a bluer color than it has ever had before. I

spit on my glove tips, touch it and can see the sizzle. Not good.

> 

> It's important now to just live with this and not fight it mentally -- mind

control -- .

The themes about the environmental elements aren’t that exciting, because you sort of have to feel the elements outside to appreciate just how immersed you are on a motorcycle. You’re literally sitting on a hot engine while wind blows across your body, sometimes rain, or hot rays of the sun. They’re drained by the heat, wanting to wear a welder’s mask to shield them from the sun. 

And later, in the cold:

> Cold out! Feels like winter! Where are we, that it should get this cold? We must be at a high altitude. I look out of the sleeping bag and this time see frost on the motorcycle. On the chrome of the gas tank it's sparkling in the early sunlight. On the black frame where the sunlight hits it it's partly turned to beads of water that will soon run down to the wheel. It's too cold to lie

around.

> 

> I remember the dust under the pine needles and put my boots on carefully to avoid stirring it up. At the motorcycle I unpack everything, get out the long underwear and put it on, then clothes, then sweater, then jacket. I'm still cold.

> 

> I step through the spongy dust onto the dirt road that has brought us here and sprint down it through the pines for a hundred feet or so, then settle down to an even run and then finally stop. That feels better. Not a sound. The frost is in little patches on the road too, but melting and dark wet tan between the patches where the early sun's rays strike it. It's so white and lacy and untouched. It's on the trees too. I walk back softly down the road as if not to disturb the sunrise. Early autumn feeling. (342)

In the same way, as a technical writer, I needed to immerse myself in the user experience, to function as a user, to step away from sipping in knowledge and instead move towards action.


## Finding balance

This balance is perhaps what I was missing from my morning documentation work, one that prevented me from getting into a state of flow and being pulled in effortless action down the river. 

In writing documentation, one might think that it’s an intellectual exercise only, but that’s not true. There’s plenty of action; in fact, the whole thrust of documentation is action expressed as sequential steps, projected onto an imagined user. There is plenty of doing, not just learning, in writing documentation. In some ways, technical documentation is a thousand times more action-oriented than other types of writing.

 \
I’m not sure if this concept is Zen-related, but in mindfulness, the idea is that you become fully present in the environment around you. You’re not chasing ideas in your head; instead, you’re focusing on all the details around you that you might have otherwise been missing. You’re not lost in thought, you’re lost in your environment. 

The narrator explains:

> Unless you're fond of hollering you don't make great conversations on a running cycle. Instead you spend your time being aware of things and meditating on them. On sights and sounds, on the mood of the weather and things remembered, on the machine and the countryside you're in, thinking about things at great leisure and length without being hurried and without feeling you're losing time. (p.7)

Because you’re immersed in the environment, you see and observe more detail than if you were encased in a car. Not just visuals, but sounds, moods, and feelings impress upon you.

Being present in the environment is another way to step outside the learning mode and perhaps integrate some balance in the activity — balance that might lead to flow. The narrator isn’t just lost in thought, proceeding through endless chautauquas. He feels the engine underneath, the g-force of the curves, the wildflowers on the roadside:

> The cycle swings into each curve effortlessly, banking so that our weight is always down through the machine no matter what its angle is with the ground. The way is full of flowers and surprise views, tight turns one after another so that the whole world rolls and pirouettes and rises and falls Away. (32)
