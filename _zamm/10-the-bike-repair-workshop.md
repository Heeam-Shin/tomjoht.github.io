I decided to take advantage of some bike repair classes near me. I liked learning on my own, but I also felt like it could be beneficial to learn from a real bike mechanic. In downtown Seattle, there's a guy named Cory Potts who runs a place called Center for Bike Repair. It started out as a place to train future bike mechanics and apprentices but also evolved into a place for community people to learn about bike repair. Best of all, it was free with donation only.

This shop was a labor of love, a side hobby for Cory who worked full time at an office job (working for the public defender as an investigator). Cory's introductory class was called Push, pull, spin, stop. As he introduced these basics, it was clear he has a specific approach toward bike repair, one that aligned in uncanny ways with the narrator in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance.

Cory wanted us to develop an intuitive understanding of bike repair, one based on observation, experimentation, and an implicit feel for the bike. He started by explaining that you can often identify the location of bike problems by visually inspecting your bike. Just like a patient brought into a hospital, you look for the signs of trauma. Those places where there's excess wear and tear can indicate where the problem is.

Later he had us bounce out bikes and listen for issues, areas that were loose, didn't sound right. By bouncing the front tire and listening to the headset, you could tell if it was loose.

He also had us undo the quick releases and wiggle the tires to make sure they're in position. He aimed to show us quick wins that didn't involve invasive procedures.

I liked his approach. He even said that there wasn't a single approach to bike repair, just like for a chef, there's not a single way to use carrots. 

With each lesson, he started with the big picture before getting into more specifics. For example, he had us make mental connections between the shifters and the derailer, then push the derailer with our hands to see it move, and also show us exposed components on demo bike parts to see the ratchet mechanism while shifting, and so on. He had us twist the barrel adjuster on the derailer and observe what happened -- the derailer shifted upwards. Then we experimented with adjusting the low screw and see what happened, and so on. 

I was more interested in learning how he thought than learning any specific bike repair. He clearly had some ideas about learning that might be expressed in the following points:

* Try to get a larger sense of what's going on. You squeeze a brake lever, and what happens? When you push a shifter, what's happening? What components are being actuated by squeezing shifting?
* Explore the components of your bike that you can put a tool in -- that have a bolt or hex or screw that you might turn. These are indicators about where you begin adjusting that component. You want to start here rather than doing something more severe like loosening the derailer cable, as that requires much more effort to reset. Like the barrel adjuster, you want to explore those components that you can adjust back to their original position easily. Experiment and see what happens when you make an adjustment to something. 
* Get a larger sense of what's happening. By getting an idea of the big picture and how things operate, the ideas at play, this is crucial. One of these big ideas was the idea of ball bearings and jam nuts. Ball bearings existed in three places: your wheel hubs, the bottom bracket, and the headset. He had components for us to handle and feel to get a better sense of their purpose, to demystify them, to help us understand what was happening behind the metal tubes and walls of our bike. 


Overall, lots of hands-on experimentation to learn, looking at the big picture of how things work, and more. 


He said that if you look at a bike long enough, it will reveal its problem to you. 

Other notes: my comment that my derailler seemed kind of cheap, and why not just replace it without a more quality component instead of trying to fiddle and fix cheap plastic parts. instead of giving me an answer straight out, wanted me to think through the answer for myself, prompted me to reason it out in my head first. then got into discussion: for bike shops, is cheaper and guaranteed to work when you replace a part so is often the fastest path to fixing it. but they often put cheap components in there. my experience at bike shop: $400 to fix drivetrain, and components complete crap.

The workshop lasted 3 hours. In comparing my own learning sessions with the guided session, I found them both useful. There's something rewarding about going at your own pace, figuring out what you specifically want to learn, attacking problems with your specific bike, and more. 

At the same time, other people can impart knowledge and perspectives that are highly valuable. Cory explained how to basically adjust my derailer in a really easy way, but also impressed upon me the larger ideas of personal experimentation and exploration as a way to increase understanding.

I had some more immediate takeaways as well, like the importance of a bike stand. By putting my bike on a bike stand, my rear cassette and derailer were at eye level and I could rotate the cranks while shifting or braking much more easily. I ended up ordering my own bike stand so that I could work on my bike at home. I also stopped by my bike store and bought another tool that I was using in Cory's workshop -- a three-headed allen wrench that makes it super easy to twist bolts. 

We never actually got to a problem I mentioned at the start -- my rear brake is still problematic. When I squeeze the lever, it seems to stick a bit. I suspect this is due to something called sticky pistons, and to fix it, I'll need to remove my brake pads, activate the pistons, and clean them. So I got some brake disc cleaner from the bike shop as well. I am thinking of building out a more dedicated and organized bike workshop in my garage.

## Tying it back to documentation


I like the idea of experiential learning as well as big picture understanding. but there's something else I'm realizing. There's a tremendous amount of information to learn, and I want to continue building my skills. To get to the level I aspire to, it will require sustained and incremental learning over a period of many months and maybe years. But I'm confident that if I dedicate a little time and space to learning each day or so, this time will accrue in big ways. 

In a podcast with Dan Grabski, we were chatting about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, since Dan had used the book in a Write the Docs presentation he gave. However, Dan included the idea of incrementalism in his book as one way to improve processes. Pirsig doesn't delve into incremental learning in the book, but this principle ties in with eastern approaches like kaizen, which is continuous improvement.

I've noticed in the past that setting aside 1 hour a day to learn something resulted in dramatic progress over the course of a month, much more than I anticipated. I want to sustain this learning momentum I have toward bikes and tools at work. That's really the difficult part for me. I get excited about something for a while, get totally into it, and after a few weeks, move on to something else.
