This series started with the realization that smartphones were fragmenting my attention span, so I abandoned my smartphone for six weeks. During that time, I rediscovered books and reading. I did eventually return to my smartphone because disconnecting from it also meant disconnecting from family, but I continued reading and making more space in my life to consume more of the content offline, rather than the social media feeds on my smartphone. 

The greatest outcome of my basic phone experiment was to rekindle interest and enjoyment in reading books. Long-form reading was an activity that Iâ€™d sort of forgotten, and even though I reverted to my smartphone, the experiment taught me to love reading again.
