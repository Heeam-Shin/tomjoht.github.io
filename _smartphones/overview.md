This series started with the realization that smartphones were fragmenting my attention span, so I abandoned my smartphone for six weeks. During that time, I rediscovered reading. I did return to my smartphone because disconnecting from it also meant disconnecting from family communication, but I continued reading and making more space in my life to consume more of the content I wanted to read, rather than the social media feeds on my smartphone. 

As I explored ways to regain my attention span, I explored theories about focus, flow, and productivity. This all led me on a fascinating journey that helped unlock more productivity in my workday and enjoyment from life.
