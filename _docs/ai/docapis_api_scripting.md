At the core of API documentation is the reference content. Whether Javadoc, Doxygen, OpenAPI, or other reference output, almost every API has reference documentation that you build, stage, and publish&mdash;usually pushing out new versions with every release. Given the centrality of building and publishing reference documentation, we can leverage AI tools to create advanced scripts to configure these tasks. This is one area that few people are focusing on, but it could provide significant time savings.
