If AI transforms the tech writing field, we'll face a choice of either resisting change and skirting with obsolescence, or reinventing our professional identity. To deal with this hypothetical dilemma, I invoke a figure from philosophy: Nietzsche's Übermensch.

## The obsolescence regime

First, a quick recap from my last post. In [AI and APIs: What works, what doesn't](ai-and-apis-what-works-and-doesnt.html), I talked about the "obsolescence regime." The gist of the argument is that competitive necessity will drive increased AI reliance, resulting in three phases: (1) First, writers who embrace AI gain a competitive advantage while AI-resistant peers fall behind. (2) Next, over-reliance on AI leads to skill atrophy, making writers unable to produce content without AI assistance. (3) Finally, AI systems no longer require human oversight and deem writers entirely obsolete. 

## An alternative path 

I argued that this dystopian outcome doesn't have to be inevitable. Rather than resist AI or become entirely dependent on it, technical writers can redefine their roles. As [James Bessen explains](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/automation-paradox/424437), new technologies often morph and reshape jobs rather than eliminate them outright. 

For example, instead of just operating AI tools, writers can reskill to become AI documentation engineers. They can learn prompting, fine-tuning, and collaboration techniques to productively partner with generative models. Skills like prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and custom LLM training can allow writers to optimize and direct AI capabilities. 

This point about redefining and reshaping our professional roles deserves more reflection, though, because changing your professional role is psychologically difficult. How to embrace professional redefinition is what this post is all about.

Redefining your professional identity can be like discarding your old body for a new one without knowing beforehand what kind of body you will soon be getting. As tech writers who may have embraced technology from humanities disciplines or other non-engineering fields, we can be stubborn about adopting new tools or workflows. 

Pivoting from hands-on writing to AI oversight poses an identity crisis, even an existential threat. If I'm no longer the one crafting each sentence, what am I? What's my role? It's far simpler to reject or dismiss new technologies that disrupt our sense of tech writer identity. This is partly why tech writer reactions to AI are all over the map, from dismissive and facetious to cautious and measured to over-embracing and hyper-optimistic.

## Guidance from philosophy 

Let's assume that to truly escape the obsolescence regime, we have to reinvent ourselves professionally. How do we do it? To embrace radical professional reinvention, we can draw insights from Nietzsche's philosophy, specifically the "last man" and the "Übermensch" ideas. (Übermensch is often translated as "overman.") 

Nietzsche described the Last Man as someone who is content with mediocrity, passive conformity, and little self-assertion. For tech writers, this might involve never questioning document requests, trusting engineering accuracy without testing, or cleaning up unclear writing without pushback. The Last Man timidly tweaks and rewrites; he or she avoids bold contributions. He or she avoids major tool changes, resists specialization in new skills like API docs, and hides their expertise to merely record others' words. They fear the struggle and uncertainty of questioning conventions and reinventing themselves. 

Opposite to the last man is the Übermensch. Rather than cling to traditional notions, the Übermensch brazenly reinvents his or her purpose and abilities. In tech writing, this could mean relinquishing writing altogether to instead direct and optimize AI-generated content. Or transitioning from manual workflows to engineering automated systems that intelligently produce content. Or something else entirely. The Übermensch might also completely dismiss AI and embrace something else.

<img src="{{site.api_media}}/professional_redefinition.jpg" alt="Redefining your professional role" />

The Übermensch might analyze product usage data and bug reports to build self-healing help content. He or she could use their API skills not just to document but design and improve the APIs themselves. Or combine doc engineering with creative code and writing to build innovative new doc platforms. 

Basically, the Übermensch writer breaks free of limiting norms and expectations, asserting his or her will to change systems and redefine value. The Übermensch does not merely react to change, they direct change. They write their own job descriptions.

Is it ridiculous to bring in this figure from philosophy? I'm not necessarily saying we have to become the Übermensch to escape the obsolescence regime, only that this model provides an interesting way of approaching professional redefinition. 

Also, I'm using the Übermensch here despite the imperfect parallel. Nietzsche's ideas are obviously more complex for the challenges I'm discussing. The Übermensch is about creating new values, living beyond common norms. It's a big idea that goes beyond learning to work with AI in tech writing and is much more existential. I don't intend to steer into philosophy too far here, but I still like the general idea and think some of it applies. I mean, there are many educated people who see AI as a humanity extinction event.

The most radical change AI presents is shifting us away from writing expertise. From sophomore year in college until now (nearly 30 years) my identity has been associated with writing. During my sophomore year, I enrolled in a Writing Fellows program that involved acting as dedicated writing tutors for various classes. As part of the Writing Fellows program, we had to write our literary biography, describing our origin stories as writers. How did you know you were a writer? That kind of essay. 

During the program, this idea of "being a writer" stuck with me. I majored in English, got an MFA in nonfiction writing, taught composition at the college level, worked as a marketing copywriter, and then as a technical writer. "Writer" has been a constant thread throughout my career. 

Now as AI tools emerge, they possess the ability to write—intelligently, coherently, and effortlessly. Do I still cling to my identity as a writer, even though it seems pretty clear that writing jobs (or portions of those jobs) will soon be replaced by AI writers? This is what I mean by the radical project that is self-redefinition. It's not like changing a board game that we're playing, from Monopoly to Chutes and Ladders. It's like changing our entire sense of who we are. This is why I invoked the Übermensch.

## Lessons from Fight Club

To reinforce the Übermensch idea in a more concrete way, let's turn to a popular film: _Fight Club_. The film _Fight Club_ shows the Übermensch mentality, as the nameless narrator [Ed Norton] shifts from passive conformity to boldly taking control. In the beginning of the film, the narrator starts as a tamed Last Man following society's scripts. But guided by Tyler Durden [Brad Pitt], Norton transforms into an Übermensch, breaking rules and asserting control. He trades cozy IKEA nesting for dangerous liberation.

If we want to do the same, to be the transformed Ed Norton, we must abandon roles dictated by tradition and create new roles. Reinventing ourselves around new skills and challenges might involve pain, like the narrator's brutal Fight Club training. But the process of self-creation builds strength to shape life on our terms. We take charge of our own changes, directing transformations rather than following prescribed algorithms. Though our efforts may be pointless on a grand scale, the willful growth itself creates meaning. This growth comes about not just from experimenting with new techniques, but transforming our identity. Our role becomes continuous rebirth.

## Expanding our identities

It could be that the whole AI wave is just a fad that will fizzle into party trick memes and nothing else. Or AI could usher in the dystopian cyborg future that science fiction movies have been depicting for decades. If the former happens, professional reinvention will only add new skills to our existing ones. If the latter happens, professional reinvention will become a requirement to stay in the game. Currently, it seems everyone is trying to figure out how to use AI in productive ways. 

I don't have all the answers to that question. Currently, most AI tools are heavily restricted in the enterprise. But through experimentation with the tools available and through experimentation on my blog, I've come up with a list of 10 starter tasks that are worth starting with.

## 10 use cases for AI in tech writer roles

The following are 10 tasks that I think have strong applicability with AI tools and documentation. For each of these tasks, consider not just the task you're performing but the identity transformation that might be taking place. That transformation of identity is the more important goal.

</table>

The transformation of your role depends on your proficiency with each task. And that proficiency can be magnified through mastery of AI tools. 

My point with the identity column is that we can't timidly cling to "writer" as our only label. Our new challenges demand fundamental identity shifts. With the Übermensch mentality, we keep progressing from limited notions toward expanded possibilities. Our identity must stay fluid, not static. Each new endeavor can prompt a radical self-redefinition. 

## Letting go of authorship

The core redefinition is to distance ourselves from writing. I've struggled to let go of authorship, and to be honest, I'm still not sure that I should. It's hard for me to let an AI do the writing instead. My early attempts using AI to write blog content produced poor quality, but I've learned techniques to blend AI content more smoothly. With practice, I can probably get much better at prompting and fine-tuning, performing more of a director role than actor role. Should I be doing this? This change scares me. Not only for the possibility of having my writing skills atrophy, but even for optics. Will people see me as a cheat or plagiarist if I use AI-generated text? Will I still feel the same about writing that "I" have produced? What will the content look like that is half AI-written, half Tom-written? It's an identity crisis.

But this is perhaps the very attachment I need to give up to evolve. My sense of self can't be based on writing alone, given how easily AI tools can write. GPT4 might sound wordy and Wikipedia-like, but what about GPT 9 or 10? At some point, my writing will be so inferior that people will no longer care who wrote it, they'll just want the good stuff.

Knowing this, I feel I should reshape myself around new skills like AI prompting and optimization, or something. I need courage to let go of old notions of my purpose. My identity has to be fluid, not fixed. But this is easier said than done. I've been building and refining my identity for the last 30 years.

## Pushing my limits

I'm attempting some experiments at work to grow new skills. Some weeks I dive so deeply into build scripts and publishing automation that the title "technical writer" seems wrong. During those weeks, I'm doing full document engineering. With AI help, I'm writing code I don't always understand. This has led to some tricky situations. When an engineer vaguely suggests enhancing the code, I might struggle to implement their recommendation. Or when a bug pops up, I might barely notice it and have trouble fixing it. But the scripts work, and they save me a ton of time. And I figure it out.

Operating complex scripts I only partly understand to automate docs feels risky. I feel caught between the tedium of manual work and the uncertainty of handing control to partially understood tools.

## Upskilling in AI

I'm trying to get more familiar with [Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google/) at work. I'm testing its limits and working to better grasp how it functions. My goal is to get good at optimizing and directing Notebook LM when solving doc bugs. Recently for a bug fix, I fed Notebook LM 30 pages of docs and bug thread text, then asked it to generate the result I needed: a short summary of the fix for release notes. 

Notebook LM produced exactly the update required, with barely any editing from me. Engineering approved it no problem. This felt odd&mdash;I wasn't fully confident in the AI's accuracy, but relied on engineering to validate it. Is this the future? Is this good? What about my subject matter expertise? Was I trading long-term productivity for short-term gains? Then again, the needed text was only a few sentences. 

Counting on AI to summarize key information made me uneasy. But as I change roles, discomfort is inevitable. Building skills in emerging areas like responsible AI use, even without a clear path, is crucial to avoid obsolescence. The way forward stays hazy, but I have to keep pushing through uncertainty into new possibilities. Or am I running towards a cliff? 

## Thinking more radically 

To truly future-proof myself, I need to think more radically. Activities like training custom LLMs or developing chatbots could redefine my role but are hard to explore while doing my current documentation duties, as these activities are time intensive and immersive. 

Despite the lack of time, I have to remind myself: The tech writer role itself might have an expiration date, so I have to reinvent despite the difficulty before that expiration date arrives. We've all got expiration dates stamped on us. Before that date arrives, we have to figure out a new plan. But what? When I spend a few days trying something new that flops (for example, trying to use AI for planning), I have nothing to show for it and fall behind. But on the flip side, imagine the wins when it works!

To avoid obsolescence, dabbling in new skills won't cut it. I need to dedicate time to completely redefining my role through high-risk, high-reward experiments. (But what the experiments should be, exactly, remains unclear.) At the same time, I can't totally ignore my current docs and work. This leaves me shakily straddling two worlds&mdash;an unsure present and unclear future. The only way forward is through radical reinvention. We have to take the plunge into unfamiliar possibilities, even if many tries fail. But what if that plunge is just a dive into party tricks? Will this all have been wasted time? This is the position we all find ourselves in.

## Conclusion

This essay wouldn't be complete without acknowledging some AI assistance. And for fun, here is the [Claude thread](https://shareclaude.top/c/vntucmr) that shows how I used AI to help with this post.
