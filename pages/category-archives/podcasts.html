<p>You can listen to the I'd Rather Be Writing podcast on most podcast platforms. This category page lists all podcasts that I've recorded as part of my site, I'd Rather Be Writing. I've been recording and sharing podcasts for more than a decade, and though my consistency has fluctuated, I've always championed recording and sharing presentations and other conversations whenever possible.</p>
