<p>The news category covers posts commenting on news around the web from intersting links I've come across. In these posts, I provide a list of links along with summaries and commentary.</p>

<p>The following content is in the <b>news</b> category:

    {% for p in site.categories.news %}
<h4 class="categoryArchive"><a href="{{ p.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{p.title}}</a> <span class="postDate"> | {{ p.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
</h4>
{% endfor %}

{% include ads.html %}
