I'd Rather Be Writing (idratherbewriting.com) is one of the most popular sites where technical writers and engineers go to stay updated with the latest technical writing news, trends, and information in the industry, especially concerning [API documentation](/learnapidoc/). Because of this, I can help increase your product or service's visibility more than any other technical writing site online.

## Ad space options and costs

<img style="float:right; padding-left:15px;" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/comics/yourcomichere.png" alt="advertising on I'd Rather Be Writing"/>

I mainly help increase visibility of your product primarily through **ad impressions**. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. In 2021, idratherbewriting.com had  1,865,635 page views, or about 5,111 page views a day. More specifically, users created 1,266,999 sessions, with 1.29 pages per session and an average of 1:19 minutes per session.

For details about how many page views, sessions, and other analytics information, see the <a href="/analytics">Site analytics</a>.

You can select from several different spaces or services below. The availability and cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col width="30%" />
   <col width="20%" />
   <col width="40%" />
</colgroup>
    <thead>

    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

For billing, I usually send you an invoice through PayPal (unless you prefer another method, such as a wire transfer or check). Even if you use another payment method, I use PayPal to keep track of invoices. Billing is done prior to any advertising efforts.

## Inline graphics {#inline_graphics}

Inline graphics (250px x 150px) appear directly inline in the post &mdash; sometimes a third of the way down, half way down, or at the bottom of the post. Within the ad block, the ads randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the inline graphics.

Each ad block can contain a maximum of four ads.

Your ad format can be PNG, JPG, or SVG, but no animated GIFs. The dimensions must be 250 x 150px pixels in size. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

<figure>
<img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Inline graphics and post links" src="<img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/inline_graphics_and_links.png
" alt="" />" alt="Inline graphics and post links" max-width="340"/><figcaption>Inline graphics and post links appear within the post, in between lines of post text. Within the ad block area, the ads rotate randomly with each page refresh.</figcaption></figure>

The graphics are accompanied by a post, preferably a [product review post](#product_review_posts) that invites users to click the link. The post title should be both relevant and enticing for a tech comm audience.

To track links, I shorten any URLs you provide to me with rebrandly. This allows me to track link clicks as well. You can change the graphic and link anytime you want.

The cost for an inline graphic ad is $1,500 per year. If you bundle the inline graphic ad with a product review ($800), the bundled cost is $2,000.

## Product review posts {#product_review_posts}

Product review posts are 800-1,000 word posts dedicated to highlighting and describing your product or service. These posts usually coincide with marketing efforts for product releases and updates. To write this post, I usually have a 20-30 minute phone call with you to find out what message you want to share. Before publishing the post, I send it to you for review to make sure it fits your messaging. Each product review post is clearly identified as a sponsored post. Links are `nofollow`.

Here are some sample product reviews I wrote previously:

Product review posts can focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article's relevance.) But they don't have to. They can also tell your product's story, zero in on a key use case, or cover other information. These review posts aren't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. I try to put a personal spin on posts to connect with my audience.

If possible, I'll download and explore your product before writing about it. But I don't have unlimited time to ramp up to an expert level on your product. I try to draw upon my industry insight and perspective to make insightful points. You'll also probably supply me with the information and messages you want to communicate.

If desired, you can also write the post. If you write the post, I'll then edit it (and review it with you prior to publishing). Alternatively, I can provide you with 5-10 questions for an FAQ style product review post. In this type of post, I pose questions to you, and you respond.

Product review posts have good results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see that my product review posts appear on the first page of search results. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

I also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when I write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as I do with idratherbewriting.com. However, note that per the [Link Schemes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en) policy with Google, I'm required to add `rel=nofollow` to any links that appear to company and product sites when I'm being paid to write the post. This attribute reduces the Pagerank that flows from my site through the link, but it avoids potential penalties or other spam-point assignments in the search algorithm.

## Inline text blurbs (API doc site only) {#inline_text_blurbs}

Inline text blurbs are short snippets of text, about 1-3 sentences in length (or 140 characters), that appear in random positions on every page of my [API documentation course](/learnapidoc/). You can define 5 ad blurbs with the variety of content and links you want. Here's an example:

<div class="randomAd"><div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info bs-callout-ad"> <div class="sponsorMessageTitle"><i>Sponsored message:</i></div>Paligo lets you get the latest code samples into your documentation easily by dynamically fetching code samples from GitHub, BitBucket, and more. Update in your code repository to automatically update your docs. A single source of truth. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://paligo.net/?utm_source=idratherbewriting&utm_medium=in-line-text">Learn more at paligo.net</a>.</div></div>

The text blurb's text changes randomly with each page refresh. However, the position of the blurb on the page remains in the same location (initially random).

The in-text ads are denoted with a Bootstrap alert-type formatting, with text that says “Sponsored message” prefacing the ad. Pages not included are contact, search, error, or other non-content heavy pages. A maximum of 4 inline blurbs (from different advertisers) can appear on each page. Links are `nofollow`. The cost for inline text blurbs to appear on the API doc site is $3,000 per year.

## Podcasts {#podcasts}

Podcasts are 30-minute audio conversations that are recorded and distributed as on-demand audio files. If you'd like your company or product to be featured in a podcast, this format can help listeners get a better sense of your personality and story. Podcasts might not have as many hits as online readers, but those who do listen to podcasts feel a stronger connection with the hosts and story than with written posts. You can see all podcasts on my site on the [Podcasts](/category-podcasts/) page. I have recorded more than 200 podcasts and have a reputation in the industry for this medium.

To prepare for podcasts, I send you about 10 questions focused on the product or service that you want highlighted. The podcast length is typically 20-30 minutes and syndicated out on iTunes, Stitcher, and other channels. The cost is $300 per podcast.

Here are sample podcasts:

* [The story behind Document360 -- podcast with founder Saravana Kumar](/blog/document-360-podcast-saravana-kumar-founder/)
* [Podcast: How Paligo is filling a niche in the CCMS market for complex documentation, with Anders Svensson](/blog/paligo-filling-a-niche-in-ccms-market-for-complex-docs/)
* [Videocast: Micro content and Flare -- Conversation with Kate Schneider](/blog/micro-content-and-flare-conversation-with-kate-schneider/)

## Footer banners {#footerbanners}

The Footer Banner (728 x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/horizontal_inline_ad-550x331.png" alt="horizontal_inline_ad" max-width="550" /> <figcaption>Horizontal Inline ads appear at the bottom of each post</figcaption></figure>

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, PNG, or SVG. (Animated GIFs aren't allowed.) Like the inline graphics, the position of the horizontal inline ads rotate randomly with each page refresh. There is no limit to the number of horizontal inline post ads that can appear below the post (currently there are 4). The cost for inline horizontal ads is $1,200 per year.

## Top Banners {#topbanners}

The top banner (400 x 60px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner. The top banner ad appears in one of the most visually dominant places on the site.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" max-width="600" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure>

Top banner ads can be JPG, PNG, or SVG. (Animated GIFs aren't allowed.) There is only one ad in the top banner ad space per advertiser, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads you want to put in this space. For example, if you have three top banner ads, the ads can rotate in this space with each page refresh. The cost for top banner ad space is $3,000 per year. Only one advertiser can rent this space because it's the main billboard for my site.

## Newsletter footers and text {#newsletter}

I send out about 3 newsletters a month to all my email subscribers (6,000 + readers). These newsletters contain links and excerpts to the latest posts (usually two articles per newsletter). Each blog post in the newsletter typically gets around 300 clicks, and the advertising graphic receives approximately 60 clicks or more. The size of the newsletter graphic is 600 x 70px graphic. Here's an [example](https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/letters/new-posts-on-i-d-rather-be-writing-59):

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/newsletterspace.png" alt="Newsletter space ad" style="max-width: 600px"><figcaption>The newsletter ad space has some of the most visibility and reach, especially for regular readers. You can see the <a href='https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/archive'>newsletter archive here</a>.</figcaption></figure>

The image format can be any standard image format (usually JPG or PNG), but not animated. The cost for advertising in the newsletter space is $1,200 per year.

Instead of a graphic, you can also replace this with a text blurb to promote a product or service. For example, you might have a release or other announcement that you want to make clear. In this case, the text would be several sentence in length and point to a URL.

## Taking the next step

If you'd like to advertise on my site, [contact me](/contact). We'll finalize details about the ad spaces you want, and then I'll send you an invoice via PayPal.
