## Overall page views

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com for 2021 according to Google Analytics.

<figure><img style="border: 1px solid #dedede" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/analytics2021pageviews.png" alt="Site traffic graph" /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing received 1,865,635 page views during 2021. This works out to an average of 5,111 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}}A "page view" is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A "session" refers to a <i>unique visit</i> to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.52.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For historical trends, here's a graph that shows the growth of the site from its inception in 2006 through 2021.

Traffic was fairly consistent from 2010 through 2017. In 2017, I added the [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/), which provided a lot of growth.

## Analytics breakdown {#analytics-breakdown}

The following table includes more details from other Google Analytics reports. To make the data more meaningful, I've provided data from 2019, 2020, and 2021 to compare the changes from one year to the next. I also round data to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1.51% is rounded to 2%; 1.49% is rounded to 1%).

All of this information is provided through Google Analytics by default. (I don't have any special scripts or other tracking cookies other than what Google adds through Google Analytics. Also note that I'm not sure how Google tracks age and gender. Google also tracks hobby categories, though I haven't shown it here.)

## API doc traffic percentage

In 2018, 59% of my site traffic came to my API documentation site ([/learnapidoc/](/learnapidoc/)). In 2019, that percentage jumped up to 72%. In 2020, this percentage climbed to 75%. And in 2021, 76%. Here's a graph showing the traffic trends to all `/learnapidoc` pages from 2017 to 2021.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/learnapidoc_traffic_2021.png" alt="API documentation traffic" /> <figcaption>The traffic to my <a href='/learnapidoc/'>API documentation site</a> accounted for 76% of the overall site traffic in 2021.</figcaption></figure>

The traffic from the API documentation visitors is outperforming other traffic sources, with 3 out of every 4 visitors going to the API documentation site.

## Top 10 API doc pages {#top-ten}

The top 10 most popular pages are as follows:

* [Step 3: Parameters (API reference tutorial)](/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_parameters.html) (11%)
* [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers](/learnapidoc/) (7%)
* [Swagger UI tutorial](/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) (7%)
* [Step 2: Endpoints and methods (API reference tutorial)](/learnapidoc/docapis_resource_endpoints.html) (5%)

* [Step 4: Request example (API reference tutorial)](/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_sample_requests.html) (2%)

Because of the interest in the API doc site, I have continued to add to it, treating it as a living site, with constantly updated and evolving content.
